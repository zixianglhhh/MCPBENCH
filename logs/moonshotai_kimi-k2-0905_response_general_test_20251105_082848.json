Inspect the source file to understand the current layout (struct def, mallocs, memcpy hierarchy, kernel call, free chain).  \n2. Generate a patch file (say, `device_struct.patch`) that replaces the verbose allocation chain with a helper template that performs *deep* allocation/copy of an arbitrarily nested struct in one call, plus matching deep-free; it keeps the user’s original kernel intact.  \n3. Apply the patch so the user sees the fixed file on disk and can compile immediately.\n\nI need two tools:  \n- `get_comprehensive_analysis` to read the current code  \n- `patch_file` to apply the generated refactor patch  \n\n(I will do only two tool calls, as required.)",

I found an API that perfectly matches your requirements for object detection functionality in your mobile app.\n\n## API Details: Image Object Detection API\n\n**Key Features:**\n- ✅ **Image URL Input**: Accepts image URLs as input via the `image_url` parameter\n- ✅ **Bounding Box Output**: Automatically generates and returns an image with bounding boxes around detected objects\n- ✅ **JSON Data**: Provides optional JSON metadata about detected objects when `return_json` parameter is set to true\n- ✅ **Mobile-Friendly**: RESTful API design that's perfect for mobile app integration\n\n**API Specifications:**\n- **Endpoint**: `POST https://api.example.com/v1/object-detection`\n- **Request Parameters**:\n  - `image_url` (required): URL of the image to process\n  - `return_json` (optional): Boolean flag to enable JSON metadata return\n\n**Usage Example:**\nWhen you call this API with an image URL and set `return_json=true`, you'll receive:\n1. A processed image with bounding boxes drawn around all detected objects\n2. Detailed JSON data containing information about each detected object, including coordinates and confidence scores\n\nThis API appears to be exactly what you're looking for - it handles all three of your requirements in a single, clean REST API call. The simultaneous delivery of both visual (bboxed image) and structured (JSON) outputs makes it ideal for mobile applications where you might want to show results to users while also processing the detection data programmatically.",
