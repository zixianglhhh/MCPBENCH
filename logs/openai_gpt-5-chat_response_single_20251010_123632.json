I should gather the key trip details required to find or recommend the best options and provide actionable guidance and next steps.\n- Plan: \n  1) Ask for essential details: pickup/return dates and times, pickup/drop-off locations, driver age, vehicle class, budget, transmission, and extras. \n  2) Offer quick guidance on common SF rental options (SFO vs. downtown), providers, and cost/fee considerations (under-25 fees, one-way fees, parking, tolls).\n  3) Once the user provides details, proceed to recommend specific companies/locations and sample pricing tips.\n- Decision: No tool invocation; request clarifying details and provide immediate practical guidance.\n\nGreat—happy to help you find a rental car in San Francisco. To get you the best options, could you share:\n- Pickup date and time (MM/DD, HH:MM AM/PM)\n- Return date and time\n- Pickup location: SFO airport or a specific neighborhood/downtown? Drop-off same place?\n- Driver age (under 25 can affect pricing)\n- Vehicle type and transmission (e.g., compact, SUV, automatic)\n- Budget range and insurance preference (basic vs full coverage)\n- Any extras needed (child seat, additional driver)\n\nQuick tips while you decide:\n- If flying into SFO: the Rental Car Center is on the AirTrain Blue Line; on-airport agencies include National, Alamo, Enterprise, Hertz, Avis, Budget, Sixt, and Thrifty.\n- Downtown SF rentals can be cheaper for multi-day trips but factor in time to reach the location and potential limited weekend hours.\n- One-way drop-offs (e.g., SF to LAX) may incur substantial fees—verify in advance.\n- Parking in SF is expensive; consider an economy or compact if you’ll park in the city.\n- Tolls: Bridges use cashless tolling; ask about toll transponder fees (FasTrak) and admin surcharges.\n- Under-25 drivers: expect young renter fees; some agencies (e.g., USAA, certain corporate codes) reduce them.\n\nShare your trip details and I’ll narrow down the best agencies, pickup spots, and estimated costs.",
