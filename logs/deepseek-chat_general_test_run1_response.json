This is because:\n\n1. **Pointer Addresses are Different**: Host and device pointers point to different memory spaces\n2. **cudaMemcpy Only Copies Pointer Values**: When you copy a struct containing pointers, only the pointer addresses are copied, not the data they point to\n\n**Recommended Improvements for Complex Scenarios:**\n\nFor handling multiple pointers or nested structs, consider these patterns:\n\n1. **Unified Memory (cudaMallocManaged)**: Simplifies memory management but may have performance implications\n2. **Helper Functions**: Create functions to handle allocation and copying for complex structs\n3. **Memory Management Classes**: Implement C++ classes to automate device memory management\n\n**Specific Code Improvements:**\n\nSince your code is in `device_struct.cu`, I recommend:\n\n1. **Use `cudaMalloc` for each pointer member** before copying the struct\n2. **Copy data separately** for each pointer member using `cudaMemcpy`\n3. **Create helper functions** for allocation/deallocation of complex structs\n4. **Consider using `cudaMallocManaged`** for simpler cases where performance isn't critical\n\n**Example Pattern:**\n```cuda\n// Allocate device memory for struct\nMyStruct* d_struct;\ncudaMalloc(&d_struct, sizeof(MyStruct));\n\n// Allocate device memory for each pointer member\ncudaMalloc(&d_struct->pointer_member, data_size);\n\n// Copy data to device pointers\ncudaMemcpy(d_struct->pointer_member, host_data, data_size, cudaMemcpyHostToDevice);\n\n// Now copy the struct itself\ncudaMemcpy(device_struct_ptr, d_struct, sizeof(MyStruct), cudaMemcpyHostToDevice);\n```\n\nThis approach ensures both the struct and the data it points to are properly accessible on the device. For more complex scenarios, consider implementing a memory management wrapper class to handle the allocation and copying logic automatically.",

However, I was able to successfully get music track recommendations based on the \"guts\" seed. Let me provide you with the analysis and recommendations:\n\n## Analysis Results\n\n**Demo Song Analysis:**\n- The file \"url/to/demo_song.mp3\" was not found in the database, so I couldn't analyze its duration or basic properties.\n\n**Speed Adjustment:**\n- There was a technical issue with the speed adjustment tool, so I couldn't process the audio file to speed it up by 1.2x or transcribe its content.\n\n## Music Track Recommendations\n\nBased on your request for tracks with the music name \"guts\", here are 5 recommended tracks that could inspire variations for your project:\n\n1. **\"vampire\"** by Olivia Rodrigo\n   - Album: GUTS\n   - Genre: Pop Rock\n   - Release Date: 2023-06-30\n\n2. **\"bad idea right?\"** by Olivia Rodrigo\n   - Album: GUTS\n   - Genre: Pop Punk\n   - Release Date: 2023-08-11\n\n3. **\"get him back!\"** by Olivia Rodrigo\n   - Album: GUTS\n   - Genre: Pop Rock\n   - Release Date: 2023-09-08\n\n4. **\"ballad of a homeschooled girl\"** by Olivia Rodrigo\n   - Album: GUTS\n   - Genre: Pop Punk\n   - Release Date: 2023-09-08\n\n5. **\"logical\"** by Olivia Rodrigo\n   - Album: GUTS\n   - Genre: Pop\n   - Release Date: 2023-09-08\n\n**Genre Insights:**\nThe \"GUTS\" album features a mix of Pop Rock and Pop Punk styles, with some pure Pop tracks. This suggests you could experiment with:\n- Energetic pop-rock arrangements\n- Raw, emotional pop-punk elements\n- Cleaner pop production styles\n\nFor your demo song analysis, you might want to ensure the file path is correct and accessible, or try using a different audio analysis tool that can access your specific file location.",

Vulnerability Management\n\n### 4.1 Regular Scanning\n- **Application:** Weekly SAST scans using Semgrep\n- **Network:** Bi-weekly Nmap scans with service version detection\n- **Dependencies:** Automated dependency vulnerability scanning\n- **External:** Quarterly third-party penetration testing\n\n### 4.2 Patch Management\n- Critical vulnerabilities: 24-hour remediation window\n- High severity: 7-day remediation window\n- Medium severity: 30-day remediation window\n- Low severity: 90-day remediation window\n\n## 5. Compliance & Documentation\n\n### 5.1 Required Documentation\n- Security policy documentation\n- Incident response playbooks\n- Change management procedures\n- Access control matrices\n\n### 5.2 Training Requirements\n- Annual security awareness training for all staff\n- Specialized training for development teams\n- Incident response team drills quarterly\n\n## 6. Continuous Improvement\n\n- Monthly security review meetings\n- Regular policy updates based on threat intelligence\n- Performance metrics tracking for security controls\n- Annual security program assessment\n\nThis protocol ensures comprehensive protection against SQL injection, cross-site scripting, and other cyber threats while maintaining operational efficiency and regulatory compliance.",

The Shanghai Composite declined -1.30%, while CSI 300 and CSI 500 showed more modest movements.\n\n**Key Trend Analysis:**\n\n1. **Shenzhen Component Index (SZCOMP) - Best Performer (+0.72%):**\n   - Shows mild upward momentum driven by technology and consumer sectors\n   - This positive trend is supported by two key factors from recent news:\n     * **Strong Manufacturing Data:** The latest PMI data showing expansion in China's manufacturing sector has boosted investor confidence\n     * **New Energy Sector Strength:** Electric vehicle and battery companies are powering the index upward, reflecting global trends in green energy transition\n\n2. **STAR Market 50 Index - Worst Performer (-2.05%):**\n   - Declining due to high valuation concerns in semiconductor stocks\n   - This suggests investors are taking profits from previously high-flying tech stocks\n\n3. **Market Divergence:**\n   - The divergence between Shenzhen's gains and Shanghai's losses indicates sector rotation\n   - Technology and manufacturing-focused Shenzhen is benefiting from positive economic data\n   - Shanghai's broader market is experiencing profit-taking after recent rallies\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe positive performance of the Shenzhen Component Index appears driven by fundamental economic improvements (manufacturing expansion) and sector-specific strength in new energy technologies, while valuation concerns are weighing on the more speculative STAR Market.",

Land Use Strategy:**\n- **Terrace farming** for steep Andean slopes to prevent erosion\n- **Contour planting** following elevation contours to minimize soil loss\n- **Agroforestry integration** with native tree species for microclimate regulation\n- **Rotational grazing** systems for integrated livestock management\n\n**2. Crop Selection by Elevation:**\n- **High elevation (2,500+ meters):** Quinoa, amaranth, potatoes, oca, olluco, native tubers\n- **Medium elevation (1,500-2,500 meters):** Maize, beans, barley, wheat, Andean grains\n- **Lower elevation (<1,500 meters):** Diverse vegetable crops, fruits, legumes\n\n**3. Sustainable Fertilizer Management:**\n- **Organic composting** using crop residues and animal manure\n- **Green manure crops** like lupines and vetch for nitrogen fixation\n- **Biofertilizers** with native microorganisms adapted to high-altitude conditions\n- **Precision application** based on soil testing and crop requirements\n\n**4. Water Management:**\n- **Ancient Andean techniques:** Waru waru (raised fields), qochas (reservoirs)\n- **Drip irrigation** for water efficiency\n- **Rainwater harvesting** systems\n- **Fog collection** in high-altitude arid regions\n\n**5. Climate Resilience Features:**\n- **Crop diversification** to spread climate risk\n- **Native crop varieties** adapted to local conditions\n- **Soil conservation practices** to maintain fertility\n- **Integrated pest management** reducing chemical dependency\n\n**Feasibility Analysis:**\nThe model demonstrates strong applicability across elevation gradients, leveraging traditional Andean knowledge with modern sustainable practices. The elevation data confirms the model can accommodate significant altitude variations while maintaining productivity and environmental sustainability.",
