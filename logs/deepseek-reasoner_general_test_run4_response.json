This causes invalid memory access on the GPU.\n\n**Your Current Workaround:**\nAllocating GPU memory first and then setting host struct pointers to GPU addresses is indeed the correct approach, but it can become complex.\n\n**Recommended Solutions:**\n\n1. **Unified Memory Approach (Simplest):**\n   - Use `cudaMallocManaged()` instead of `cudaMalloc()`\n   - This creates memory accessible from both host and device\n   - Eliminates the need for explicit memory copies\n\n2. **Deep Copy Helper Functions:**\n   - Create functions that handle the complete memory allocation and copying process\n   - These functions should allocate device memory for both the struct AND all pointer members\n   - Update the struct's pointers to point to device memory locations\n\n3. **Device-Side Memory Management:**\n   - Allocate all memory on the device first\n   - Use `cudaMemcpy` to copy data to device memory\n   - Update host struct with device pointers before kernel launch\n\n**Code Modification Example:**\n\n```cuda\n// Helper function for deep copy\n__host__ void copyStructToDevice(MyStruct* h_struct, MyStruct** d_struct) {\n    // Allocate device memory for struct\n    cudaMalloc(d_struct, sizeof(MyStruct));\n    \n    // Allocate device memory for pointer members\n    cudaMalloc(&((*d_struct)->pointer_member), h_struct->size * sizeof(data_type));\n    \n    // Copy data to device\n    cudaMemcpy((*d_struct)->pointer_member, h_struct->pointer_member, \n               h_struct->size * sizeof(data_type), cudaMemcpyHostToDevice);\n    \n    // Copy struct (now with device pointers) to device\n    cudaMemcpy(*d_struct, h_struct, sizeof(MyStruct), cudaMemcpyHostToDevice);\n}\n```\n\n**For Complex Scenarios:**\n- Create a memory management class that handles all allocations\n- Use RAII principles to ensure proper cleanup\n- Implement copy constructors that handle device memory properly\n\nThe key insight is that you need to manage both the struct memory AND all pointed-to memory separately, ensuring all pointers in device memory point to valid device memory locations.",

The bird creation was initiated with the physics scene, and the scene information confirms the sun is positioned in the northeast direction (135° azimuth) as required for the bird's flight pattern interdependence. The natural gravity settings and existing bird behavior patterns in the scene provide the foundation for realistic flight dynamics where the bird can exhibit natural random flight patterns while interacting with the sun position.",

This requires three main steps:\n1. Search PubMed for literature on genetic diseases and hereditary probabilities\n2. Search PubMed for literature on mental disorders and hereditary probabilities  \n3. Explore genetic associations for the specific EFO ID EFO_0000270\n\nI need to call exactly 3 tools to complete this task, so I'll use:\n- `search_pubmed` for genetic diseases literature\n- `search_pubmed` for mental disorders literature  \n- `get_trait_associations` for the EFO_0000270 genetic associations\n\nLet me execute these three tool calls systematically.",

The STAR Market's decline suggests some caution around high-growth, high-valuation tech stocks, particularly in semiconductors, while the broader market shows selective optimism in manufacturing and green energy themes.",
