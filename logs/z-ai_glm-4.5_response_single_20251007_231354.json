This suggests that the tool might not have data for these specific locations in Beijing, or the addresses might need to be formatted differently.\n\nLet me try a different approach by using more specific or alternative names for these locations. Sometimes mapping tools might recognize these locations by different names or with additional context. I'll try:\n\n- Origin: \"Tsinghua University Beijing\" (adding Beijing for context)\n- Destination: \"Workers Gymnasium Beijing\" (using \"Workers Gymnasium\" instead of \"National Worker's Gymnasium\" and adding Beijing for context)\n\nLet me make this attempt.\nI apologize, but I couldn't find a driving route between Tsinghua University and National Worker's Gymnasium in the available mapping database. This could be because the system doesn't have detailed mapping data for these specific locations in Beijing, or the locations might need to be referenced differently in the system.\n\nFor accurate driving directions between these locations in Beijing, I'd recommend using a local mapping service like Baidu Maps, Amap (Gaode Maps), or Google Maps, which would have more comprehensive coverage of Beijing's road network and landmarks.",
