Allocate device memory for pointer content\ncudaMalloc(&d_data, size);\n// 2. Copy data to device\ncudaMemcpy(d_data, h_data, size, cudaMemcpyHostToDevice);\n// 3. Set host struct pointer to device address\nhostStruct.data = d_data;\n// 4. Copy struct to device\ncudaMemcpy(d_struct, &hostStruct, sizeof(MyStruct), cudaMemcpyHostToDevice);\n```\n\nThe analysis report at `C:/Users/user/Desktop/MyProject/src/device_struct_analysis_report.txt` contains specific code modification suggestions for your implementation.",

For mental disorders hereditary probabilities, the search returned similar results showing articles on graft-versus-host disease biomarkers.\n\n**Genetic Associations for EFO_0000270:**\n\nThe EFO_0000270 corresponds to \"Cystic fibrosis.\" The GWAS analysis revealed a strong genetic association:\n- **Variant rs113993960** in the **CFTR gene**\n- **Effect size**: beta = -2.5 (FEV1 % predicted)\n- **Significance**: p-value = 1.20e-20 (highly significant)\n- **Study focus**: CFTR variants and lung function decline in cystic fibrosis\n- **Sample ancestry**: European population\n- **Publication reference**: PMID 22085960 from American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2011)\n\nThe research demonstrates clear genetic biomarkers for cystic fibrosis, with the CFTR gene variant showing strong associations with disease progression and lung function outcomes. These biomarkers could be valuable for risk stratification and clinical management of patients with this genetic disorder.",

First, I'll export the code for the NODE_TIMER component from their Figma design. Then, I'll use the CountDown_StartAndEndDate function to create a real countdown based on the parameters extracted from the design.\n\nFrom the Figma export, I can see:\n- The component is a CountdownTimer with specific parameters\n- The parameters include: Ele=\"vocab_timer_user001\", StartDate=\"2025-07-15T09:00:00\", EndDate=\"2025-08-15T09:30:00\"\n\nHowever, I notice the EndDate in the export appears to have a typo (20245 instead of 2025). I'll use the correct 2025 date for the countdown function call.\n\nBased on the Figma design export, here's your countdown code:\n\n**Countdown Component Code:**\n```jsx\n<CountdownTimer start={Date.now()} duration={60000} onComplete={alert('Time up!')}/>\n```\n\n**Design Parameters:**\n- Element ID: vocab_timer_user001\n- Start Date: 2025-07-15T09:00:00\n- End Date: 2025-08-15T09:30:00\n\nI attempted to create the real countdown timer, but the system indicates the end time has already passed. This suggests that either:\n1. The dates in your design are set in the past, or\n2. There may be a timezone issue with the current system time\n\nTo implement a working countdown, you should update the StartDate and EndDate parameters to future dates that are appropriate for your vocabulary memorization session. The countdown will then display the remaining time between those dates in your designated element (vocab_timer_user001).",

Let me provide you with the integrated analysis:\n\n**Drug Design Strategy for BRCA1-Targeted Therapy:**\n\n1. **Target Prioritization:** BRCA1 (ENSG00000012048) is the highest priority target with:\n   - High druggability score (0.85)\n   - Known successful drug classes (PARP inhibitors)\n   - Critical role in DNA repair pathways\n\n2. **Candidate Compound Analysis:** The BRCA1 candidate compound appears to be a benzamide-based structure similar to known PARP inhibitors. For proper ADME/RO5/QED evaluation, I would need:\n   - The exact SMILES string of your specific BRCA1-targeting compound\n   - Or confirmation to use the provided candidate compound\n\n3. **Design Recommendations:**\n   - Focus on PARP inhibitor analogs for BRCA1 targeting\n   - Consider combination therapies with BRCA2 inhibitors\n   - Optimize for blood-brain barrier penetration if treating metastatic disease\n   - Monitor for potential toxicity in DNA repair pathways\n\nTo complete the pharmacological property analysis, please provide the specific SMILES string of your BRCA1-targeting compound, or confirm if you'd like me to analyze the candidate compound \"O=C(NC1=CC=CC=C1)C2=NC=NC=N2\" found in the target details.",

The Shanghai Composite declined 1.30%, CSI 300 was slightly down 0.21%, and CSI 500 posted modest gains of 0.17%.\n\n**Analysis of SZCOMP's Outperformance:**\nThe Shenzhen Component Index's 0.72% gain, the highest among the major indices, appears driven by two key factors according to the latest financial news:\n\n1. **Positive Manufacturing Data**: The expansion in China's manufacturing sector, as indicated by the latest PMI data, has boosted investor confidence. This manufacturing strength likely benefited the many industrial and technology companies listed on the Shenzhen exchange.\n\n2. **New Energy Sector Strength**: The surge in electric vehicle and battery companies significantly contributed to the index's performance. Shenzhen is home to many leading clean energy and technology firms that benefited from continued growth in the electric vehicle market and renewable energy investments.\n\nThe divergence between indices suggests sector-specific movements rather than broad market strength, with technology and manufacturing-oriented companies (heavily weighted in SZCOMP) outperforming while other sectors faced headwinds from valuation concerns and profit-taking activities.",

Setup & Libraries:**\n- Install Computer Vision Toolbox and Image Processing Toolbox\n- Activate the Deep Learning Toolbox for advanced recognition\n\n**2. Basic Object Detection Workflow:**\n```matlab\n% Load and preprocess image\nimg = imread('environment_image.jpg');\ngrayImg = rgb2gray(img);\nbinaryImg = imbinarize(grayImg);\n\n% Edge detection for obstacle identification\nedges = edge(grayImg, 'Canny');\n\n% Object detection using regionprops\nstats = regionprops(binaryImg, 'Area', 'Centroid', 'BoundingBox');\n\n% Display results\nfigure;\nimshow(img);\nhold on;\nfor k = 1:length(stats)\n    rectangle('Position', stats(k).BoundingBox, 'EdgeColor', 'r', 'LineWidth', 2);\nend\n```\n\n**3. Advanced Recognition with Deep Learning:**\n```matlab\n% Load pre-trained object detector (YOLO or SSD)\ndetector = yolov4ObjectDetector('coco');\n\n% Detect objects\n[bboxes, scores, labels] = detect(detector, img);\n\n% Display results\ndetectedImg = insertObjectAnnotation(img, 'rectangle', bboxes, labels);\nimshow(detectedImg);\n```\n\n**4. ROS Integration for Real-time Processing:**\n```matlab\n% Connect to ROS network\nrosinit\n\n% Subscribe to camera topic\ncameraSub = rossubscriber('/camera/image_raw');\n\n% Process incoming images\nimgMsg = receive(cameraSub);\nimg = readImage(imgMsg);\n% Apply detection algorithms\n```\n\n### Java Simulation with Physics Engine:\n\nYour simulation environment has been successfully created with:\n- Scene: 'Robot_Environment' with floor and gravity [0, -9.81, 0]\n- Robot 1: Franka robot at position [0, 0, 0] (ID: 120f8da1-b13e-48bb-a44e-556e08b55d87)\n- Robot 2: Carter robot at position [0, 6, 0] (ID: 863a19fe-ad83-4c11-b84e-c1ee3ae9ee1f)\n- Obstacles: obstacle1 at (2, 0, 1), obstacle2 at (-1, 0, 3)\n- Target: at (5, 0, 5)\n\n**Next Steps for Simulation:**\n1. Implement obstacle avoidance algorithms in your Java simulation\n2. Use the MATLAB vision system to provide real-time object detection data\n3. Study how the carter robot influences the franka robot's obstacle avoidance behavior\n4. Implement autonomous decision-making logic for both robots\n\n**Key Integration Points:**\n- MATLAB can serve as the computer vision subsystem\n- Java handles the physics simulation and robot control\n- Implement ROS-bridge for communication between MATLAB and Java components\n\nThe environment is now ready for you to implement and test various obstacle avoidance strategies in this multi-robot scenario.",
