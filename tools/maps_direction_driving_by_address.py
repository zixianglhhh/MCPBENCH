def maps_direction_driving_by_address(origin_address, destination_address) -> str:
    '''"""
Plans a driving route between two locations using their specific addresses.

This function generates driving directions based on the provided origin and 
destination addresses. Each address should be the most specific name relevant 
to the context, without including broader location details such as city, state, 
or country. For example, use "Avalon Clinton" instead of 
"Avalon Clinton, New York".

Args:
    origin_address (str): The specific name of the starting location 
        (e.g., "Avalon Clinton").
    destination_address (str): The specific name of the destination location 
        (e.g., "Metropolitan Museum of Art").

Returns:
    str: A textual description of the driving route, including key roads and 
    estimated travel time, or an error message if the route cannot be determined.
