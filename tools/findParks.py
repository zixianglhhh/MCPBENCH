    """
    Search national parks by multiple criteria with simple pagination over mock data.

    This tool demonstrates filtering by state codes, keyword search across name/description, activity filters, and
    paginated output. All data is sourced from an in-memory example dataset for illustrative purposes.

    Args:
        stateCode (str): Comma-separated state codes (e.g., "CA,AZ").
        park_type (str): What type of park you want to find, should all be in lowercase, in the form of xxx park.
        limit (str): How many park per state you want to find in total, in the range [1, 50].
        activities (str): What activities you want to find in the park, should all be in lowercase.

    Returns:
        str: A formatted list of matching parks or an error/empty-result message when no matches or invalid
        parameters are provided.
