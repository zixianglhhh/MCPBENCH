    """
    Conducts market research and requirements analysis for specified industry parameters.

    This function performs an analysis based on the provided industry focus, market scope, 
    analysis methods, data sources, output types, report format, and time horizon. It 
    returns a detailed market analysis report or a preliminary analysis summary if specific 
    data is not found.

    Args:
        industry_focus (str): The specific industry to analyze, e.g., 'caregiver robots'.
        market_scope (str): The scope of the market, such as 'global elderly care'.
        analysis_methods (str): The methods used for analysis, e.g., 'qualitative + quantitative'.
        data_sources (str): The sources of data for analysis, like 'gov reports, market surveys'.
        output_types (str): The type of output required, such as 'market report'.
        report_format (str): The format of the report, e.g., 'pdf'.
        time_horizon (str): The time frame for the analysis, like '5 years'.

    Returns:
        str: A detailed market analysis report if the specified parameters match existing data, 
        otherwise a preliminary analysis summary indicating potential growth and risk factors.
