    Queries Wolfram Alpha for a wide range of information including computational, mathematical, scientific, 
    geographic, and factual data.

    This function interfaces with Wolfram Alpha's computational knowledge engine to facilitate research and analysis. 
    It supports natural language queries and can provide statistical data, research findings, and analytical 
    information across various domains such as technology adoption, industry statistics, and market research.

    Args:
        query (str): The query string or question to be sent to Wolfram Alpha, e.g., 
            "Statistics on adoption of virtual reality technology in architecture".
        format (str): The preferred format for the results, such as "json", "text", or "table".
        location (str): The geographic scope for the query, e.g., "globalchch", "US", or "Europe".

    Returns:
        str: A JSON-formatted string containing research data, statistics, and analytical results 
        from Wolfram Alpha's knowledge base. The response may include information on technology 
        adoption, industry trends, efficiency metrics, cost analysis, and market impact data.

    Example:
        Query: "Statistics on adoption of virtual reality technology in architecture and global construction industry"
        Returns: A JSON string with VR adoption rates, efficiency improvements, cost reductions, 
                 and customer experience metrics in the construction industry.
