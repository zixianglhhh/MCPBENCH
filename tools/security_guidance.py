    """
    Provides actionable, non-sensitive security recommendations for applications 
    and data systems based on a given query. The function returns best-practice 
    checklists, minimal configuration or code snippets (e.g., MySQL TLS, 
    least-privilege GRANTs, parameterized queries), data protection advice 
    (e.g., PII handling, encryption at rest/in transit), access control/RBAC 
    patterns, logging and monitoring strategies, and compliance pointers 
    (e.g., GDPR, FERPA). It ensures no secrets are requested or returned, 
    using placeholders in examples.

    Args:
        query (str): A non-empty string representing the security-related 
        question or topic for which guidance is sought.

    Returns:
        str: A string containing security recommendations and best practices 
        tailored to the query, formatted as checklists, code snippets, or 
        advisory notes.

Use encryption at rest (AES-256) and in transit (TLS 1.2+).\n5. Regularly back up data and store backups in a secure, isolated environment.\n6.
