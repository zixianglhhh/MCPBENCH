Key elements:\n- Edge & CDN: Use a CDN (Cloudflare/Akamai/CloudFront) for static assets and edge caching. Implement edge-side rendering for critical pages where appropriate.\n- Frontend: Next.js (React + TypeScript) for hybrid SSR/SSG and client-side hydration; component library and Tailwind CSS for design consistency. Split into Public site and Admin app (can share components).\n- API Layer: API Gateway (AWS API Gateway / Kong) routing to backend services. Use REST or GraphQL (Apollo) for flexible data needs. Implement versioning.\n- Microservices: Separate services for Auth, Content, Catalog (if e-commerce), Orders/Transactions, Notifications, Analytics, and Media handling. Each service exposes clear API contracts and uses message bus for async work.\n- Backend: Node.js with NestJS (TypeScript) or Python Django for fast API development, with clear modular boundaries. Use containerization (Docker) and orchestration (Kubernetes / EKS / GKE).\n- Worker & Queue: Use a worker system (RabbitMQ / AWS SQS + ECS / Celery) for long-running tasks (emails, image processing, report generation, payment reconciliation).\n- Data Layer: Primary RDBMS (Postgres) for transactional data, Redis for caching and sessions, ElasticSearch / OpenSearch for full-text search & analytics, S3-compatible object storage for media and backups.\n- Security & Identity: Use OAuth2 / OpenID (Auth0, Keycloak), strong RBAC for admin operations, encrypted secrets via HashiCorp Vault or cloud secrets manager.\n- Observability: Centralized logging (ELK/EFK), metrics (Prometheus + Grafana), tracing (Jaeger), and error monitoring (Sentry).\n- CI/CD & Infra: GitHub Actions/GitLab CI for pipelines, TerraForm / Pulumi for infra as code, Helm charts for k8s deployments. Blue/green or canary deployments with feature flags.\n- Backup & DR: Automated DB backups, cross-region snapshot replication, warm standby plan for RTO/RPO targets.\n- Performance: Caching at CDN, cache-control headers, server-side rendering for critical content, lazy loading of images, image optimization (responsive images / WebP), and resource prefetching.\n- Developer Experience: Monorepo (Nx or Turborepo) or separate repos with shared component packages. Local dev with Docker Compose and preview environments per PR.\n\nDeliverables: architecture diagram (textual), component responsibilities, data flow for key user journeys (public browse, sign-up, checkout), security considerations and compliance note (GDPR, PCI-DSS if handling payments).",

            "hardware_requirements": "Cloud-first, managed services recommended. Example baseline (adjust for traffic):\n- Frontend Hosting: Serverless (Vercel) or small node pool on k8s. If self-hosted: 2-3 replicas of app servers (2 vCPU / 4GB RAM) behind load balancer.\n- API / Backend Services: Kubernetes node pool with autoscaling. Start with 3 nodes (4 vCPU / 16GB) in prod; scale to 6+ based on load.\n- Database: Managed Postgres (RDS / Cloud SQL) db.r5.large equivalent (2 vCPU / 16GB) for small/medium; scale to db.r5.xlarge+ for heavy load. Use multi-AZ for HA and at least one read replica.\n- Redis: Managed cache (small cluster, e.g., cache.m4.large equivalent). Use cluster mode for failover.\n- Elasticsearch/OpenSearch: Small cluster (3 nodes) with 32GB heap for production search workloads; scale horizontally for indexing/traffic.\n- Object Storage: S3 with lifecycle rules; provision based on expected media size (100GB+ typical)\n- Message Queue / Worker: ECS / Fargate tasks or k8s jobs; workers can be c5.large types depending on CPU needs.\n- Network & CDN: Use CDN with edge caching; WAF (AWS WAF / Cloudflare) and DDoS protection.\n- Backups & DR: Cross-region snapshotting of DB, daily backups, point-in-time recovery with retention policies.\n\nSizing guidance: monitor and set autoscaling policies by CPU, memory, and custom metrics (queue length, request latency). For high throughput sites consider separate node pools for CPU-bound and memory-bound workloads.\n\nCost considerations: start with managed services to reduce ops overhead; estimate monthly spending across managed DB, cache, object storage, CDN, and container hosting. Use reserved instances/savings plans for high-usage predictable workloads.",
            "interaction_interface": "UX Principles & Strategy:\n- Mobile-first design and responsive components; design system for consistency\n- Accessibility: WCAG 2.1 AA as baseline (semantic HTML, keyboard navigation, ARIA where needed)\n- Performance budgets: keep LCP <2.5s, TBT under thresholds; use Lighthouse scoring as KPI\n- Clear information architecture: primary navigation, search-first for content-heavy sites\n- Onboarding flows: progressive disclosure for new users, contextual tips and empty-state guidance\n- Personalization: use behavioral data and user segments for content/product recommendations; privacy-compliant tracking\n- Microinteractions: subtle feedback for actions (toasts, skeleton loaders, button states)\n- Forms & Validation: inline validation, helpful error messages, minimize friction (social auth, autofill)\n\nUX Patterns & Flows:\n- Homepage -> Category -> Item -> CTA (add-to-cart / sign-up / read more)\n- Account area: profile, order history, saved items, settings\n- Admin: content editor with preview, roles & permissions, media manager\n\nPerformance & Perceived Performance:\n- Prioritize critical content via SSR/SSG; lazy-load non-critical components\n- Image optimization: automatic resizing, srcset, modern formats, CDN image service\n- Prefetch key resources and implement link rel=preload for fonts and critical scripts\n\nAnalytics & UX Optimization:\n- Instrument with product analytics (GA4, Mixpanel or Segment) and event taxonomy\n- Use heatmaps (Hotjar/FullStory) and session recording for qualitative insights\n- Run regular usability testing (remote moderated + unmoderated) and run A/B tests for major changes\n- Use feature flags to expose new experiences to subsets of users and measure impact\n\nAccessibility & Internationalization:\n- Implement i18n with locale-aware routing and translation pipeline\n- Ensure RTL support for applicable languages\n- Provide adjustable text sizes and high-contrast mode if needed",
            "test_optimization_plan": "Testing Strategy:\n- Unit Tests: Jest + React Testing Library for frontend; unit tests for backend services\n- Integration Tests: API contract tests using Pact or integration with a staging DB\n- End-to-End Tests: Playwright or Cypress for critical flows (signup, checkout, content publishing)\n- Load & Performance: k6 or Gatling to simulate traffic; set SLOs for latency and error rate\n- Security Testing: Static analysis (Snyk/Dependabot), dynamic scanning (OWASP ZAP), regular vulnerability scans\n\nCI/CD & Release Strategy:\n- CI pipeline: run lint, unit tests, build, and security scans on PRs. Build artifacts are versioned and deployed to staging.\n- CD: Automated deployment to staging on PR merge, manual promotion to production or automated with gates. Use canary or blue/green deployments.\n- Monitoring & Alerts: define SLOs and alerts for latency, error rates, and saturation; integrate with PagerDuty/Slack\n\nUX Optimization & Experimentation:\n- Implement an experimentation platform (LaunchDarkly / GrowthBook) and A/B testing framework tied into analytics\n- Establish hypothesis-driven experiments: define metric, segment, sample size, duration\n- Use session replay / heatmaps for understanding user behavior and identify friction points\n\nObservability for Optimization:\n- Real user monitoring (RUM) to measure LCP, FID/Cumulative Layout Shift and correlate with user segments\n- Synthetic monitoring (Pingdom / Datadog Synthetics) for key pages\n- Regular sprint-based retrospectives on performance regressions and UX metrics\n\nOperational Practices:\n- Run monthly performance audits and accessibility scans\n- Keep a backlog of UX debt and performance work; prioritize in planning\n- Continuous improvement cycle: instrument -> hypothesize -> test -> analyze -> roll out\n\nOptional Add-ons:\n- PWA support for offline-first experiences and improved loading on repeat visits\n- Progressive personalization using ML recommendation service (TensorFlow/Vertex AI) for product/content suggestions\n- Chatbot or conversational interface for customer support (integrate with Zendesk or custom NLP)\n\nRoadmap & Deliverables (high level):\n1. Discovery & Requirements: stakeholder interviews, analytics audit, performance baseline\n2. Architecture & Design: detailed architecture diagrams, ERD, wireframes, component library\n3. MVP Development: core flows, auth, CMS, search, analytics, basic admin\n4. QA & Load testing: staging validation, security review, accessibility fixes\n5. Launch & Monitoring: production rollout, dashboards, alerting, feedback loop\n6. Iteration & Optimization: data-driven UX improvements, A/B tests, scale infrastructure\n\nNote: This proposal is intentionally technology-agnostic where appropriate and prescriptive where beneficial. I can tailor specifics (detailed ER diagram, API contract examples, low-level infra terraform modules, or UI wireframes) once you share the project type (content site, SaaS product, e-commerce), expected traffic, compliance needs (PCI/GDPR/HIPAA), and timeline.",

Save the program as a single file named analysis.py. The program should be placed by the tool at path: code/complex_dataset_analysis/analysis.py. Requirements for the generated program:\n\n1) Usage & CLI\n- Provide a command-line interface so the user can run: python analysis.py --input /path/to/complex.csv --output_dir ./code/complex_dataset_analysis/output --target <optional_target_column>\n- Default input path should be './complex.csv' and default output_dir './code/complex_dataset_analysis/output'.\n\n2) Functionality\n- Load the CSV robustly using pandas (handle large files via chunks if needed, but assume fits in memory by default).\n- Automatic EDA: data shape, dtypes, head, summary statistics, missing value summary, unique counts per column, histograms for numeric, bar plots for categorical, correlation heatmap (Pearson) for numeric.\n- Automatic target detection: if the user does not pass --target, the program should try to detect a target column by heuristics (column name contains 'target','label','y' or the last column). If none found, assume unsupervised.\n\n3) Supervised pipeline (when target detected):\n- Detect if target is classification or regression: if target is numeric with many unique values treat as regression, if discrete with small number of unique values treat as classification.\n- Preprocessing:\n  - Separate numeric and categorical features.\n  - Impute missing values (SimpleImputer: median for numeric, constant/most_frequent for categorical).\n  - Encode categoricals (OneHotEncoder with handle_unknown='ignore' or OrdinalEncoder when high-cardinality is present).\n  - Scale numeric features with StandardScaler when needed.\n  - Optionally apply variance threshold or SelectKBest (mutual_info or f_regression) for feature selection.\n- Model training:\n  - For classification: try LogisticRegression (with class_weight='balanced'), RandomForestClassifier, and GradientBoosting (or HistGradientBoostingClassifier). For regression: try LinearRegression/Ridge, RandomForestRegressor, GradientBoostingRegressor.\n  - Use StratifiedKFold (classification) or KFold (regression) CV with 3-5 folds and cross_val_score to compare models.\n  - Use small randomized hyperparameter search (RandomizedSearchCV) for top candidates (limit iterations to keep runtime reasonable).\n  - Choose best model by mean CV score (accuracy/F1 for classification, RMSE/R2 for regression).\n- Evaluate best model on held-out test split (train_test_split 80/20). Produce metrics and classification report or regression metrics; save predictions with probabilities when applicable.\n- Save trained model with joblib and write a short summary report (Markdown or JSON) with metrics, selected features, and CV results.\n\n4) Unsupervised pipeline (no target):\n- Run PCA and explain variance plot.\n- Try clustering: KMeans for a range of k values (e.g., 2-10) and compute silhouette score to pick k; produce cluster assignments and cluster centers summary.\n- Run IsolationForest for anomaly detection and output top anomalies.\n\n5) Outputs & artifacts\n- Save: EDA summary (CSV/Markdown), figures (PNG), model file(s) (joblib), predictions CSV, and a final report (Markdown and JSON) into the output_dir.\n- Log progress to console and write a detailed log file in output_dir.\n\n6) Dependencies & reproducibility\n- Use standard libraries: pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn, joblib, scipy. If xgboost is present detect and use as optional.\n- Add a requirements.txt generator or print pip install suggestion at the end.\n- Set random_state seeds for reproducibility.\n\n7) Code quality\n- Well-structured with functions for each major step (load_data, perform_eda, detect_target, build_pipeline_and_train, unsupervised_analysis, save_outputs).\n- Include helpful docstrings and comments so a developer can adapt the script.\n- Handle common edge cases (all missing column, constant columns, high-cardinality categoricals).\n\n8) Execution note\n- The script should be conservative in heavy computations: default hyperparameter search iterations small (e.g., n_iter=20), max CV folds 5, and include CLI flags to increase compute (e.g., --fast to use minimal work, --full to run more exhaustive search).\n\nAt the top of the file include a short README comment that describes how the program works and how to run it.\n\nDo not create other files; create a single Python file saved at the output path.

Try these URLs in order and gracefully handle failures:\n     - https://raw.githubusercontent.com/datasets/global-temp/master/data/monthly.csv\n     - https://data.giss.nasa.gov/gistemp/tabledata_v4/GLB.Ts+dSST.csv\n  2) Atmospheric CO2 monthly (Mauna Loa) — try:\n     - https://raw.githubusercontent.com/owid/co2-data/master/owid-co2-data.csv (this file contains CO2 global series; extract year/month and global_mean)\n     - https://gml.noaa.gov/webdata/ccgg/trends/co2/co2_mm_gl.csv\n  3) Global mean sea level (monthly/annual) — try:\n     - https://raw.githubusercontent.com/benbovy/sea-level/master/data/sea_level.csv\n     - https://raw.githubusercontent.com/scienceofdoom/datasets/master/Global_mean_sea_level.csv\n\n- Preprocessing:\n  - Parse dates into datetime index; resample to monthly or annual as needed. Focus analysis on the last 10 years (use available end date up to current year).\n  - Align series to the same frequency (monthly) and handle missing values (interpolate linearly; drop NA that can't be interpolated).\n\n- Modeling & Forecasting:\n  - For each individual series (temp anomaly, CO2, sea level): fit a simple ARIMA/SARIMAX (use statsmodels.tsa.statespace.SARIMAX) with order=(1,1,1) and seasonal order=(0,0,0,0) as a straightforward baseline. Forecast next 20 years (monthly steps) and produce confidence intervals.\n  - Build a multivariate linear regression model (sklearn.linear_model.LinearRegression) to predict temperature anomaly from CO2 and sea level aggregated to annual means. Train on last 10 years of available data, then forecast temperature for next 20 years by feeding forecasted CO2 and sea level into the regression model.\n\n- Output & Visuals:\n  - Save CSV files with processed historical data (last 10 years) and forecasted values for each series in ./outputs/ (create directory if needed).\n  - Plot historical + forecast (with 95% CI) for each series and save PNGs to ./outputs/.\n  - Print a short summary to stdout with key rates (e.g., average annual trend over last 10 years for each series, and predicted change by year 2045 from the models).\n\n- Robustness & notes:\n  - Use try/except for downloads; if all downloads for a dataset fail, generate a synthetic fallback series that mimics typical observed trends (CO2 +2 ppm/yr linear trend with seasonal cycle; temp +0.02°C/yr; sea level +3.3 mm/yr) and clearly log that fallback was used.\n  - Add comments with citations for the preferred authoritative sources (NOAA Mauna Loa, NASA GISS, University of Colorado / CSIRO sea level datasets, OWID) and a brief limitation note.\n\n- Required libraries: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, requests, statsmodels, sklearn, os, datetime. If statsmodels or sklearn are missing, the script should catch import errors and print instructions.\n\n- Keep the code clear and well-commented.\n\nSave the file exactly to ./climate_trend_analysis.py",

The program should be practical and ready-to-run (assuming dependencies are installed). Include the following components:\n\n1) Clear header with purpose and dependencies.\n2) Data loading helper: support loading CSV files with columns ['label','message'] where label is 'spam'/'ham' or 'scam'/'legit'. Provide example how to download or format the SMS Spam Collection dataset.\n3) Preprocessing: lowercase, strip, remove URLs, emails, phone numbers, and optionally normalize whitespace. Tokenization can be done by scikit-learn's TfidfVectorizer with basic analyzer; include optional NLTK stopword removal (but keep it optional).\n4) Model pipeline: TF-IDF vectorizer + classifier. Use LogisticRegression (with class_weight='balanced') and fallback to SGDClassifier if dataset is large. Include GridSearchCV example for hyperparameter tuning.\n5) Training, evaluation: train/test split, stratified sampling, metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, F1, confusion matrix). Print results.\n6) Persistence: save and load model using joblib with functions save_model(path) and load_model(path).\n7) Inference API: function predict_messages(messages, model, threshold=0.5) that returns predictions and probabilities. Map probability threshold to 'scam' label; allow returning a confidence score.\n8) Mark-as-junk integration example: show a simple function mark_as_junk(message_id, message_text, storage='junk_folder') that simulates moving the message to a junk folder (write to a JSONL or CSV file). Provide guidance for integrating with real messaging app (hook points, asynchronous queue, runtime performance considerations).\n9) CLI: if __name__ == '__main__' section that supports commands: train --data path/to.csv --model-out path, predict --model path --input 'text' or --input-file path, mark-junk demo.\n10) Comments on deployment: batch vs streaming inference, using threshold tuning, false positive mitigation (whitelists, user feedback loop), logging and monitoring, GDPR / privacy considerations, and further improvements (transformers, embeddings, ensembling, rule-based prefilters).\n\nMake sure code is Python 3.9+ compatible and lists pip install requirements in a comment (e.g., scikit-learn, pandas, joblib, nltk). Keep code modular and include docstrings for main functions. Keep output concise but complete.\n\nDo not include any external credentials or calls to external APIs. The code file should be self-contained except for standard libraries and the listed pip installs. ",

Requirements:\n\n1) Features:\n   - Accept either: a) a command to launch (e.g., \"-- cmd -- my_program --arg\"), or b) attach to an existing PID (\"--pid 1234\").\n   - Accept a target CPU usage percentage (per-process average over a short window), e.g., --target 30 (meaning aim to keep the target process around 30% CPU usage).\n   - Support platform-specific approaches:\n       - On Linux: prefer to use cgroups v1/v2 if available to limit CPU; if not available or no permissions, fall back to using nice, CPU affinity, and cooperative throttling via SIGSTOP/SIGCONT cycles (throttle duty-cycle approach). Document permission needs (root for cgroups or setting affinity beyond current user).\n       - On Windows: use psutil to set process priority and CPU affinity. If psutil isn't installed, detect and give clear instructions to install it.\n   - Use psutil for cross-platform process monitoring and for CPU percent calculations.\n   - Implement a feedback loop that periodically measures the process CPU percent over short intervals (e.g., 0.5s samples aggregated over 2s window) and adjusts throttle parameters to move CPU usage toward the target. For example, vary the duty-cycle of SIGSTOP/SIGCONT or change number of allowed CPUs.\n   - Provide a safe shutdown (handle SIGINT/SIGTERM) and restore any modified settings (affinity, niceness, cgroup membership) where possible.\n   - Provide verbose logging and a dry-run mode where it only prints planned actions without applying them.\n\n2) CLI options:\n   - --pid PID: attach to existing process\n   - --cmd \"...\": launch a command under optimizer control\n   - --target N: target CPU percent (default 50)\n   - --interval S: sampling interval seconds (default 0.5)\n   - --window W: compute average over W seconds (default 2)\n   - --min-duty and --max-duty: min/max duty cycle for stop/resume strategy\n   - --use-cgroups: force attempt to use cgroups on Linux\n   - --dry-run\n   - --verbose\n\n3) Implementation notes:\n   - Keep external dependencies minimal: psutil required; if cgroups is used, try to use libcgroup via subprocess (cgcreate/cgset) or write to /sys/fs/cgroup when possible. Provide clear fallbacks if cgroups not usable.\n   - Throttling method: implement duty-cycle control that alternates between allowing process to run and suspending it: based on duty cycle d (0-1), run for d*T and suspend for (1-d)*T where T is a small cycle (e.g., 0.2s). The controller should slowly adjust d to move measured CPU toward target.\n   - Include docstrings, usage examples, and clear comments.\n   - Ensure code checks permissions where needed and warns the user.\n\nGenerate a single-file script with helpful console output, and save as the provided output_name. Keep code understandable and reasonably commented. Do not include any additional files.",

The city seeks economic transition from coal to diversified, sustainable industries, tourism and services, while preserving cultural assets. Key constraints: legacy contaminated sites, air quality and public-health concerns, limited water resources, seasonal temperature extremes, existing urban form with older infrastructure, growing demand for mobility, and the need to protect nearby heritage sites from development pressure. Objectives: 1) Sustainable, climate-adapted urban and architectural design; 2) Low-emission, efficient multi-modal transport network; 3) Environmental remediation, air and water quality improvement, soil stabilization; 4) Economic transition and social inclusion; 5) Phased, financeable implementation with measurable KPIs. Provide a strategic analysis with prioritized actions, spatial and design recommendations (density, land use, building typologies), transport planning (public transit, freight, active mobility, TOD), environmental protection measures (air, water, soil, green corridors, energy), brownfield remediation, heritage protection guidelines (buffers, view corridors, materials, adaptive reuse), governance and financing mechanisms, an actionable phasing plan (short/medium/long term), and monitoring indicators. Keep recommendations practical for a mid-sized Chinese prefectural city with potential provincial/national funding and private investment. "

Generate an optimized replacement module that preserves the same public function names and inputs where possible but greatly improves performance using these techniques:\n\n- Use NumPy vectorization to replace Python loops for array/numeric operations.\n- Provide optional numba.jit-accelerated implementations when numba is installed; include graceful fallbacks to the pure NumPy implementation if numba is not available.\n- Parallelize large, independent computations using concurrent.futures (ProcessPoolExecutor) or multiprocessing with chunking. Use chunk size heuristics and allow the user to pass num_workers parameter to control parallelism.\n- Add type hints, clear docstrings, and simple input validation for public functions.\n- Keep memory usage reasonable: use in-place operations when safe, avoid unnecessary copies, and document when operations are memory-heavy.\n- Add a small benchmarking helper function that, if the original module provides functions like compute_* or process_*, will allow quick comparisons between the original and optimized implementations using time.perf_counter.\n- Add logging to report when numba or parallel execution is used.\n- Include a dependencies note at top and a short example usage under if __name__ == '__main__': showing how to run a benchmark.\n\nMake sure generated code handles typical numerical inputs: Python lists, tuples, NumPy arrays. Convert inputs to NumPy arrays internally with np.asarray and appropriate dtype.\n\nIf the original file defines any functions with names matching common compute patterns (e.g., compute_matrix_ops, heavy_loop, process_signals, integrate_values), implement optimized versions for these names and provide fallback wrappers that match signatures: preserve keyword args and default values.\n\nIf the original file path 'heavy_numeric_computations.py' cannot be read by you, assume typical heavy-numeric-computation routines and implement a robust, generic optimized module with the features above. Provide clear comments in the code explaining the optimization choices. \n\nProduce high-quality, ready-to-run Python code using only standard library plus numpy and optionally numba. Keep code compatible with Python 3.8+. \n\nReturn only the code to be saved (no additional explanation).",
