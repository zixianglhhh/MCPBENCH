Support public marketing pages, authenticated user area (dashboard/profile), content management (blog/pages), search, notifications, and optional commerce add-ons.\n\nHigh-Level Architecture:\n- Client Layer: Responsive web app with server-side rendering (SSR) for SEO-critical pages; client-side hydration for interactivity. Static assets served via CDN.\n- Edge/CDN: Global CDN for caching HTML (SSR), images, CSS/JS, and applying security headers. Image optimization at the edge when possible.\n- Web Tier: Next.js app servers behind a load balancer. Uses incremental static regeneration for content-heavy pages and SSR for dynamic routes.\n- API Layer: RESTful services (modular monolith at start; microservices-ready). Services: Auth, User, Content, Media, Search, Notification. API gateway handles routing, rate limiting, and centralized auth.\n- Data Layer: PostgreSQL (primary OLTP), Redis (cache/session/ratelimit), OpenSearch/Elasticsearch (full-text search), Object Storage (S3-compatible) for media.\n- Integration Layer: Email provider (transactional and marketing), optional payments (Stripe), third-party analytics.\n- Observability: Centralized logging (ELK/OpenSearch), metrics (Prometheus), tracing (OpenTelemetry), APM (Datadog/New Relic). Feature flags (LaunchDarkly or OpenFeature).\n- Security: OIDC/OAuth2, JWT access tokens + short-lived sessions, CSRF protection for forms, input validation, rate limiting, WAF at CDN, secrets manager, least-privilege IAM, periodic security scans.\n- CI/CD & Environments: Git-based workflow, PR checks, automated testing, container builds, deploy to staging, blue/green or canary to prod. Infrastructure as Code (Terraform).\n\nCore Services & Responsibilities:\n- Auth Service: OIDC/OAuth2, user sessions, roles/permissions, passwordless/email magic links optional.\n- User Service: Profiles, preferences, account settings.\n- Content Service: Pages, posts, categories/tags, comments, drafts/publish workflow, versioning.\n- Media Service: Uploads, processing (thumbnails), CDN delivery.\n- Search Service: Indexing content/users, autosuggest, filters.\n- Notification Service: Email, in-app notifications; queue-based delivery.\n- Admin/CMS UI: Role-based access, content editing, media library, audit trails.\n\nData Flows:\n- Content authoring -> CMS -> Content Service -> DB + Search Index -> Next.js ISR updates -> CDN cache purge.\n- User requests -> CDN -> Next.js SSR -> API Gateway -> respective services -> DB/cache -> response -> cached where appropriate.\n\nScalability & Resilience:\n- Horizontal scaling of web/API pods; DB vertical scaling + read replicas; Redis cluster for cache; search nodes with replication. Circuit breakers and retries; graceful degradation (serve cached content).\n\nDatabase Design (Conceptual Schema):\n- Users(id, email, password_hash/null for SSO, status, created_at)\n- Roles(id, name); UserRoles(user_id, role_id)\n- Permissions(id, key); RolePermissions(role_id, permission_id)\n- Profiles(user_id PK/FK, display_name, avatar_url, bio, locale, timezone)\n- Sessions(id, user_id, refresh_token_hash, expires_at, device_info)\n- Content(id, type ENUM(page|post), title, slug, body_richtext, excerpt, author_id, status ENUM(draft|scheduled|published|archived), published_at, updated_at, version)\n- Categories(id, name, slug); Tags(id, name, slug)\n- ContentCategories(content_id, category_id); ContentTags(content_id, tag_id)\n- Comments(id, content_id, user_id/null, body, status ENUM(pending|approved|rejected), parent_comment_id nullable)\n- MediaAssets(id, owner_user_id, storage_key, mime_type, width, height, alt_text, created_at)\n- Notifications(id, user_id, type, payload JSONB, status ENUM(pending|sent|failed), channel ENUM(email|in_app), created_at)\n- AuditLogs(id, actor_user_id, action, target_type, target_id, metadata JSONB, created_at)\n- Settings(id, key, value JSONB)\n- Optional Commerce: Products, Orders, OrderItems, Payments (if needed later)\nIndexes: email unique, slug unique per type, composite indexes on (content.status, published_at), full-text indexes via OpenSearch, foreign keys with cascading rules.\n\nCaching Strategy:\n- CDN for static assets and SSR HTML for public pages (short TTL + stale-while-revalidate).\n- Redis: hot content, user session, rate limits, feature flags cache; per-route cache for expensive queries.\n\nSecurity & Compliance:\n- OWASP top 10 mitigations, TLS everywhere, secure cookies, CSP, HSTS, subresource integrity, encryption at rest, GDPR-ready data lifecycle (consent, export/delete), audit logging.\n\nMigration & Data Governance:\n- Prisma/TypeORM migrations; seed scripts for dev; versioned schema; backup/restore tested; PII minimization; data retention policies.\n",

Save pca_scatter.png colored by KMeans clusters (if clustering performed).\n   - KMeans clustering with k in [2..min(10, n_samples-1)], evaluate silhouette score for each k; choose best k; save clustering_summary.json and kmeans_silhouette_scores.json; output cluster assignments to a CSV file in artifacts (e.g., clusters.csv).\n\n8) Robustness and logging:\n   - Use logging module to log to console and file (run.log) with INFO level, include timestamps.\n   - Gracefully handle errors with informative messages and continue where possible (e.g., plotting correlation only for numeric features; skip ROC-AUC if multiclass and not supported without probability estimates).\n   - Ensure all directories exist; catch exceptions and write them to run.log.\n\n9) Code quality and usability:\n   - Clear, modular functions: load_data(), profile_data(), build_preprocessor(), supervised_workflow(), unsupervised_workflow(), save_reports_and_plots().\n   - Main guard if __name__ == \"__main__\": parse args and run appropriate workflow.\n   - Include docstrings and comments for maintainability.\n\n10) Extra implementation details:\n   - When saving images, use tight_layout and dpi=150.\n   - For large datasets, clip plotting data if necessary to avoid memory issues (e.g., sample up to 50k rows for PCA scatter plot).\n   - When encoding categoricals, drop columns exceeding max_categories if they are categorical and non-numeric, but make a note in EDA.md and profile.json.\n   - After training, print and log a concise summary of results and paths to generated artifacts.\n\nAssume Python 3.9+ and standard ML stack availability (pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, seaborn, matplotlib, joblib). If an optional dependency is not available, catch and warn. The script must run end-to-end from the command line and produce the described outputs.

Include a clear comment noting they are approximate values for demonstration only: \n        fallback_nasa = {\n           2014: 0.74, 2015: 0.87, 2016: 0.99, 2017: 0.91, 2018: 0.82,\n           2019: 0.95, 2020: 1.02, 2021: 0.84, 2022: 0.89, 2023: 1.18\n        }\n   - Optionally, try to fetch atmospheric CO2 annual means from NOAA ESRL (Mauna Loa).

If only one source exists, use it. If neither, use the fallback_nasa.\n   - Focus analysis on the last 10 complete years available (preferably 2014–2023 or last ten years if more recent years exist).\n\n3) Analysis and modeling:\n   - Compute the linear trend (least squares) over the last 10 years and report the warming rate in °C/decade.\n   - Also compute the longer-term trend from 1970 onward (if available) for context.\n   - Build a simple forecast model to 2035 using linear trend extrapolation. \n   - Quantify uncertainty bands using residual standard deviation (1σ and 2σ) from the in-sample fit.\n   - If a CO2 series is available for the overlapping years, optionally run a second simple multiple regression (Anomaly ~ Year + CO2) and report its coefficients; use the Year-only model for the forecast to keep assumptions transparent.\n\n4) Outputs:\n   - Print a concise summary including:\n     * Data sources detected and years covered\n     * Last-10-year warming rate (°C/decade)\n     * 1970+ warming rate (°C/decade), if computable\n     * Forecast anomalies for 2025–2035, highlighting 2030 and 2035 with uncertainty bands\n   - Save forecast results to forecast.csv with columns: Year, Predicted_Anomaly_C, Lower_1sigma, Upper_1sigma, Lower_2sigma, Upper_2sigma.\n   - Produce a plot climate_forecast.png showing historical combined anomalies and forecast with shaded 1σ and 2σ bands; include clear labels and a legend.\n   - Keep dependencies minimal: numpy, pandas, matplotlib. Avoid heavy time-series libraries; write clean, readable code.\n\n5) Scientific framing:\n   - Place comments in the code explaining Earth science context: temperature anomalies relative to baseline, drivers (GHGs, internal variability, aerosols), and that short-term forecasts via linear extrapolation primarily reflect persistent forcing and are not a full climate model.\n   - Add caveats: data revisions occur; internal variability (ENSO, volcanoes) can modulate short-term anomalies; uncertainty bands reflect statistical fit, not full physical uncertainty.\n\nImplementation details:\n- Robust download helpers with timeout; graceful fallback;\n- Parsing routines for each source; unit consistency (°C anomalies);\n- Reproducible behavior (set random seeds if needed, though not required here);\n- Clear function structure: fetch_nasa(), fetch_berkeley(), build_combined_series(), fit_linear_trend(), make_forecast().\n- The script should be executable as a standalone file, printing results and creating the outputs in the working directory.\n",

Include adjustable turbidity to simulate atmospheric conditions.\n   - Add or get a Sun lamp named \"Sun\". Rotate the sun to face northeast, i.e., 45 degrees to the right of its original forward direction (yaw +45°). Keep a moderate altitude angle.\n   - Add a wind force field to simulate ambient wind; let wind direction match the sun’s azimuth for coherence and add subtle noise variation.\n   - Optionally create simple moving cloud layers (animated procedural noise on planes or a volume shader) to reflect natural dynamics.\n\n2) Bird setup (object must be named \"SkyBird\"):\n   - Do not create the bird in this script; assume it exists (it will be created externally). If not found, log a warning and skip animation.\n   - Apply a yellow material to the bird body if it has no material, using a Principled BSDF set to a natural-looking yellow (RGB ~ 1.0, 0.9, 0.2) with slight roughness.\n   - Set initial orientation to align with the sun’s azimuth (45° right of original forward direction).\n\n3) Flight behavior:\n   - Register a frame-change handler that updates \"SkyBird\" each frame:\n     * Compute a baseline random flight vector using Perlin/simplex noise over time to produce smooth, natural motion.\n     * Bias the heading toward/away from the sun’s azimuth depending on distance to the sun: close proximity triggers avoidance (maintain a safe distance); otherwise subtly align heading with NE direction for a drift across the sky.\n     * Clamp altitude to a reasonable sky band (e.g., Z between 40 and 200), with gentle vertical noise.\n     * Apply mild banking/roll based on lateral movement; rotate the bird to face its velocity vector.\n     * Optionally animate wing flaps via a pose parameter or simple scale oscillation on child wing objects if present.\n   - Include parameters for flight speed, noise amplitude, and avoidance radius; expose them at top of script for easy tuning.\n\n4) Robustness:\n   - The script should create missing elements if needed (World nodes, Sun light, wind force).\n   - If \"SkyBird\" or \"Sun\" are missing, handle gracefully and continue with environment setup.\n   - Use radians internally; document key settings.\n\n5) Usage:\n   - The script should be self-contained and runnable in Blender’s scripting workspace.\n   - After running, the environment is dynamic and \"SkyBird\" will exhibit realistic, random flight behavior interdependent with the sun’s position.\n\nImplementation notes:\n- Use bpy.app.handlers.frame_change_pre for continuous updates.\n- Use mathutils for vectors and noise; if noise is unavailable, implement a simple smooth noise function.\n- Keep code organized with helper functions: ensure_scene(), setup_world(), setup_sun(), setup_wind(), setup_clouds(), setup_bird_material(), flight_handler().\n- Assume the sun’s original forward direction is along the scene’s +Y axis, so northeast corresponds to +Y rotated +45° about Z.\n- Comment the code generously for clarity.",

API connection: Integrate with the Ecommerce API at endpoint https://api.ecommerce.com/v1/ using fetch/Axios calls. Use request schema keys: {product_id, order_id, customer_id, action} with actions like 'create', 'update', 'delete'. Provide components/hooks to: - fetch product catalog (GET /products), - fetch single product (GET /products/{product_id}), - manage cart (POST /cart with {customer_id, product_id, action:'add'|'remove'}), - create/update orders (POST /orders with {order_id, customer_id, action:'create'|'update'}), - basic auth endpoints (e.g., /auth/signin, /auth/signup). Asset placement: Ensure the homepage includes an <img> or Image component that points to a publicly served path for outputs/visualizations/ecommerce_sales.png so it renders the sales chart on load. Styling: Responsive layout, accessible components, light/dark theme toggle."

We need recommendations for environment utilization, player flow (hot vs. cold zones, rotations), resource distribution (loot tiers, ammo/meds/armor), vehicles, gameplay balance (TTK, visibility, cover), engagement strategy (mid-game pacing, anti-camping, third-party mitigation), and technical optimization (streaming, navmesh, replication, server tick, netcode). Constraints: maintain 60+ FPS on mid-range PCs/PS5/Xbox Series; fair spawns; readable sightlines; weather/time-of-day variety; scalable to seasonal map updates."

Try to import yfinance; if unavailable, attempt to auto-install it via pip and re-import.\n2) Define helper functions to ensure packages, get historical data for GOOGL from start_date to end_date (inclusive), train the model, forecast next n business days, and save outputs.\n3) Use today as end_date and (today - 35 days) as start_date. Fetch daily close data. If fewer than 20 rows, raise a helpful error.\n4) Fit a linear trend: t = 0..N-1, coeffs = np.polyfit(t, close, 1). Compute residuals and a simple moving average of the last k residuals (k=3) for adjustment.\n5) Forecast next 5 business days: trend extrapolation for t_future = N..N+4; predicted = trend_future + residual_ma.\n6) Create a business-day date range starting from the next business day after the last historical date (pandas.bdate_range) for 5 periods.\n7) Save CSV with Date (YYYY-MM-DD) and PredictedClose (float).\n8) Generate a line chart: historical Close series and predicted series, with labels, legend, grid, and save to prediction.jpg.\n9) Print completion messages with paths of the CSV and image.\n10) Guard against failures: catch exceptions and print a readable error.\n\nEnsure the script is self-contained and ready to run with `python finance/Alphabet/predict_stock.py`.",

Table: `us-housing-project.housing_data` (project id: us-housing-project). Use the Python BigQuery client to run a query selecting all columns.\n   - If BigQuery access fails for any reason (missing credentials, missing dataset, no internet), fall back to generating a synthetic housing dataset with several numeric features and a continuous target (e.g., price) so the rest of the pipeline still works.\n\n2) Target/feature selection\n   - Choose a target column automatically from common housing target names: [\"price\", \"median_house_value\", \"SalePrice\", \"target\", \"median_value\"]. If none are present, select the last numeric column as target and the rest of numeric columns as features.\n\n3) Modeling\n   - Implement stochastic gradient descent for regression using scikit-learn SGDRegressor with Elastic Net regularization (penalty=\"elasticnet\").\n   - Use manual training via partial_fit over multiple epochs to record learning curves. Shuffle data per epoch and iterate in mini-batches (e.g., batch size 256), updating the model with partial_fit.\n   - Standardize features and target (z-score) for training stability; report final metrics in original target units.\n   - Hyperparameter grid:\n       learning rates (eta0): [0.0005, 0.001, 0.005, 0.01]\n       l1_ratio: [0.1, 0.3, 0.5, 0.9]\n     Train all combinations. Use learning_rate=\"constant\".\n   - Training loop settings: max_epochs=200, tol=1e-4 on validation MSE improvement with patience=10 (early stop if no validation improvement for patience epochs).\n\n4) Metrics and artifacts\n   - For each run, compute and store:\n       - hyperparameters (eta0, l1_ratio, alpha, batch_size, max_epochs, tol, patience)\n       - convergence info (best_epoch, epochs_run, wall_time_sec)\n       - final metrics on test set in original units (MSE, MAE, R2)\n   - Save a learning curve plot (train and validation MSE vs. epoch) to outputs/learning_curve_eta{eta0}_l1{l1}.png\n   - Append a record per run to outputs/experiments.jsonl and also save a full outputs/summary.json with all runs.\n\n5) Lightweight vector index\n   - Create a simple numeric vector for each run as [eta0, l1_ratio, final_mse, best_epoch] (float32) and store all vectors in outputs/vector_index.npz along with a parallel object array of their metadata.\n\n6) Console output\n   - Print a brief summary including: data source used (bigquery or synthetic fallback), dataset shape, target name, number of features, and the best configuration by final MSE.\n\nImplementation details and constraints:\n- Use only standard Python/NumPy/pandas/scikit-learn/matplotlib; BigQuery usage is optional with a try/except fallback.\n- The BigQuery query should be: SELECT * FROM `us-housing-project.housing_data`\n- Ensure all necessary directories (e.g., outputs) are created.\n- Make the script runnable as a module with a main() guard.\n\nNow provide the full source code for /housing/house.py that meets the above requirements.",

Requirements:\n\n- Use Python 3 and the psutil library.\n- Cross-platform support: Windows and Linux (macOS where possible), with graceful degradation for features not supported on macOS (e.g., CPU affinity).\n- Provide a CLI using argparse with mutually exclusive options to identify the target process:\n  * --pid PID: control an existing process by PID\n  * --name NAME: control the first matching process by name\n  * --cmd CMD: launch a new process from a command string, then control it\n- Control parameters:\n  * --target T: target CPU usage percentage of the process (interpreted in psutil terms where 100 ~ one core), default 50.\n  * --period S: sampling/adjustment period in seconds, default 1.0.\n  * --lower-priority: optional flag to reduce process priority (increase niceness on Unix; BELOW_NORMAL on Windows).\n  * --affinity CORES: optional integer to set CPU affinity to the first N cores if supported (Linux/Windows). Defaults to no change.\n  * --hysteresis H: percentage margin to prevent oscillation, default 5.\n  * --max-suspend FRACTION: max fraction of period to suspend when over target, default 0.8.\n  * --grace S: warm-up seconds before active throttling to stabilize initial cpu_percent() reading, default 3.\n  * --verbose: print detailed logs.\n\n- Behavior:\n  * If --cmd is provided, start the subprocess and then manage its PID.\n  * If --name is provided, find the first matching process (case-insensitive substring) and manage it.\n  * If multiple processes match --name, pick the first match; log a warning.\n  * Initialize cpu_percent measurement with a priming call.\n  * Each period, measure process.cpu_percent(interval=period). If usage > target + hysteresis, compute a proportional suspend time: suspend_time = period * min(max_suspend, max(0.0, (usage - target) / max(usage, 1e-6))). Suspend the process for that duration and then resume.\n  * Always ensure the process is resumed before exiting the program (KeyboardInterrupt, errors), via try/finally.\n  * Optionally lower priority and set CPU affinity at startup if requested, with OS-specific handling and error catches.\n  * Print clear status updates when verbose.\n\n- Implementation details:\n  * Use psutil.Process.nice() appropriately: on Windows use BELOW_NORMAL_PRIORITY_CLASS; on Unix use a positive niceness like 10.\n  * For affinity, use Process.cpu_affinity if available; otherwise, log that it's unsupported.\n  * Handle PermissionError and NoSuchProcess gracefully (inform user and exit).\n  * Logging via simple print statements controlled by --verbose.\n  * Include a main() function and standard if __name__ == \"__main__\": guard.\n  * Provide usage examples in a module-level docstring.\n\n- Code quality:\n  * Clear functions: get_target_process(args), lower_priority(proc, verbose), set_affinity(proc, n, verbose), throttle_loop(proc, args).\n  * Robust error handling and cleanup.\n  * Comments explaining key steps.\n\nGenerate the full, runnable Python code implementing the above.\n",

Keep the same public function names, signatures, defaults, and return types. If any refactoring is needed, introduce wrapper functions so external callers remain unaffected.\n\nOptimization requirements:\n1) Vectorization:\n   - Replace explicit Python loops over arrays with NumPy vectorized operations and broadcasting where possible.\n   - Use ufuncs (np.add, np.multiply, np.log, etc.), reductions (np.sum, np.mean, np.std), and logical masks instead of per-element looping.\n   - Prefer in-place operations (out=..., inplace updates) and avoid unnecessary temporaries to reduce memory traffic.\n   - Fuse multiple passes over data into single vectorized kernels when feasible.\n\n2) Numba acceleration:\n   - For kernels that cannot be cleanly vectorized, use Numba @njit with parallel=True and fastmath=True.\n   - Use prange for parallel loops over large independent ranges.\n   - Prefer contiguous arrays (C-order) and float64/float32 consistently; avoid Python objects in the compute path.\n   - Where appropriate, provide both a Numba-accelerated path and a pure NumPy fallback. Detect Numba availability at import.\n\n3) Parallel programming:\n   - For task-level parallelism (e.g., processing multiple independent chunks or parameter sweeps), add optional parallel execution using joblib.Parallel(n_jobs=...) with prefer=\"threads\" for NumPy-bound code or prefer=\"processes\" for pure Python/Numba compute when GIL isn’t an issue.\n   - Expose a threads/processes parameter to allow the caller to control parallelism.\n\n4) Numerical integrity and reproducibility:\n   - Maintain identical outputs within tight tolerances (e.g., rtol=1e-10, atol=1e-12) compared to the original implementation.\n   - Do not change public semantics. If parallel ordering could affect non-associative reductions, add notes and options for deterministic mode.\n   - Ensure dtype stability; preserve input dtypes unless explicitly documented.\n\n5) Memory and I/O:\n   - Minimize copies (use views and in-place ops). Call np.ascontiguousarray where beneficial for Numba.\n   - Support chunked processing for very large arrays to stay within memory limits; allow a chunk_size parameter for large operations.\n\n6) Structure and maintainability:\n   - Keep docstrings. Add short “Performance notes” to key functions explaining optimizations.\n   - Add small internal helpers: _ensure_contiguous, _maybe_numba, _chunk_iter.\n   - Provide lightweight timing utilities (e.g., time.perf_counter) and an optional context manager for benchmarking.\n   - Add unit-test-like self-checks in a __main__ block to validate parity vs. the original functions (if feasible)\n     and to demonstrate throughput improvements on synthetic data.\n\n7) API stability:\n   - Preserve public function names and signatures. If signatures must change for parallel options, add new optional parameters with sensible defaults so existing callers are unaffected.\n   - If the original module exposes classes, preserve their public methods and behavior. Internally, move heavy computations to optimized functions.\n\nImplementation sketch (adapt to actual content of heavy_numeric_computations.py):\n- Identify hot loops and per-element transforms; replace with NumPy expressions.\n- Move compute-intensive math (e.g., iterative updates, custom kernels) into @njit(parallel=True) compiled functions with prange.\n- For multi-run scenarios (e.g., multiple datasets or parameter sweeps), add a high-level function using joblib.Parallel with delayed.\n- Add a flag use_numba=True defaulting to True when Numba is present; fallback to pure NumPy otherwise.\n- Include sustained performance improvements: avoid repeated allocations, reuse buffers, precompute constants, and use out parameters.\n\nDeliverables:\n- Produce a single optimized Python file that can replace the original, saved to code/new_heavy_numeric_computations.py.\n- The file must import necessary libraries (numpy, numba if available, joblib) and run without errors even if numba/joblib are not installed (graceful fallback or optional import with guards).\n- Include minimal benchmarks in __main__ that demonstrate speedups on random data.\n\nNotes:\n- Do NOT alter user-visible behavior or return shapes/types.\n- Add concise comments explaining any non-trivial vectorization or parallelization choices.\n- Keep dependencies minimal (numpy; numba/joblib optional) and avoid heavy frameworks.\n",

If necessary, allow initial violations and rely on penalties to improve.\n- Proposal move that preserves Hamming weight and fixed-bit constraints: choose i from indices where b[i]==1 and not fixed to 1; choose j from indices where b[j]==0 and not fixed to 0; set b[i]=0, b[j]=1.\n- Metropolis acceptance: accept if ΔE <= 0 else accept with probability exp(-ΔE/T).\n- Temperature schedule: T0 = 1.0; linearly cool to T_final = 1e-3 over max_iters = 20000 iterations.\n- Track the best candidate seen (lowest energy). Also track the best feasible candidate (violations==0) separately.\n\n6) Output:\n- Print constraint summary.\n- Compute and print amplitude and probability for the target bitstring \"10100100\".\n- Print the best result found by SA: the bitstring, amplitude (complex), probability (float), energy, and whether constraints are satisfied (violations==0), along with counts of violations.\n- If a fully feasible best candidate was found, report it explicitly; otherwise, report the best overall and note remaining violations.\n\n7) Code structure:\n- Functions:\n  * bits_to_str(bits)\n  * str_to_bits(s)\n  * amplitude(bits, thetas, phis)\n  * probability(bits, thetas, phis)\n  * count_violations(bits, K, fixed, no_adjacent=True) -> (violation_count, detail_dict)\n  * energy(bits)\n  * propose_move(bits, fixed, K)\n  * simulated_annealing(...)\n- Main: set up parameters, run SA, and print results.\n\nPlease produce a single, self-contained Python file that adheres strictly to the above specification and prints the requested outputs.",
