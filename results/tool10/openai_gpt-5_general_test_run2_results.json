Expose REST and limited GraphQL for aggregate reads. API gateway handles routing, auth, rate limiting.\n- Authentication & Authorization: OAuth 2.0/OIDC (Auth0/Cognito) with JWT access tokens and refresh tokens. RBAC with roles and fine-grained permissions. CSRF protection for web forms. Session management via secure HTTP-only cookies.\n- Data Layer:\n  - Primary relational DB: PostgreSQL (managed, e.g., AWS RDS) with Prisma ORM.\n  - Cache: Redis (managed, e.g., ElastiCache) for sessions, rate limiting, hot content, and query results.\n  - Object storage: S3 for media assets with signed URLs and image resizing at the edge.\n  - Search: OpenSearch/Elasticsearch or Postgres FTS for site search/autocomplete.\n- Messaging/Async: SQS/SNS (or equivalent) for queued jobs (emails, image processing, webhooks).

The script must be robust, self-contained, and runnable from the command line.\n\nRequirements:\n1) CLI and configuration:\n   - Use argparse to support:\n     --data_path (str, default \"complex.csv\")\n     --task (str, choices: [\"auto\", \"classification\", \"regression\", \"unsupervised\"], default \"auto\")\n     --target_column (str, optional)\n     --id_columns (str, optional, comma-separated list, e.g. \"id,record_id\")\n     --predict_path (str, optional) for making predictions on a separate dataset using the trained model (only for supervised tasks)\n     --test_size (float, default 0.2)\n     --random_state (int, default 42)\n     --n_jobs (int, default -1)\n     --max_categories (int, default 50) Used to optionally handle high-cardinality categoricals; if unique values exceed this threshold, treat with frequency encoding fallback.\n   - Create outputs directory at code/complex_dataset_analysis/outputs (ensure it exists).\n\n2) Data loading and preprocessing:\n   - Load the CSV into pandas DataFrame.\n   - If id_columns are provided, drop them from feature set.\n   - Infer column types: numeric (int/float), categorical (object/category), boolean.\n   - If target_column is provided:\n       * Use it as y and the rest (minus id cols) as X.\n     Else:\n       * If task == auto, attempt to infer target:\n         - Prefer columns named in [\"target\", \"label\", \"y\"]. If none, check the last column; if it has > 1 unique value and not an obvious ID, treat as target; otherwise fall back to unsupervised.\n   - Task inference when target is known:\n       * Classification if y is discrete or has relatively small number of unique values or y dtype is object/category.\n       * Regression if y is numeric and has many unique values.\n     When auto and no target detected, set task to unsupervised.\n   - Build preprocessing pipelines using scikit-learn:\n     * Numeric pipeline: SimpleImputer(strategy=\"median\"), StandardScaler.\n     * Categorical pipeline: SimpleImputer(strategy=\"most_frequent\"), OneHotEncoder(handle_unknown=\"ignore\") by default; implement a simple frequency encoding fallback for very high cardinality columns (unique > max_categories).\n   - Use ColumnTransformer to combine pipelines.\n\n3) Supervised learning:\n   - Split data using train_test_split with given test_size and random_state. Stratify if classification where possible.\n   - Candidate models and parameter grids:\n     Classification:\n       * LogisticRegression(max_iter=1000)\n         - params: C: [0.1, 1.0, 10.0]\n       * RandomForestClassifier(random_state)\n         - params: n_estimators: [100, 300], max_depth: [None, 10, 20]\n       * GradientBoostingClassifier(random_state)\n         - params: n_estimators: [100, 200], learning_rate: [0.05, 0.1]\n     Regression:\n       * LinearRegression() (no grid)\n       * RandomForestRegressor(random_state)\n         - params: n_estimators: [200, 500], max_depth: [None, 10, 20]\n       * GradientBoostingRegressor(random_state)\n         - params: n_estimators: [200, 500], learning_rate: [0.05, 0.1]\n   - Wrap each candidate in a Pipeline(preprocessor, model) and evaluate via GridSearchCV.\n   - Cross-validation:\n       * Classification: StratifiedKFold(n_splits=5, shuffle=True, random_state).\n       * Regression: KFold(n_splits=5, shuffle=True, random_state).\n   - Scoring:\n       * Classification: primary metric f1_weighted; also report accuracy, roc_auc_ovo if possible.\n       * Regression: primary metric neg_root_mean_squared_error; also report MAE and R2 on hold-out.\n   - After selecting best model, fit on training set and evaluate on test set.\n   - Feature importance:\n       * If model has feature_importances_ (RF/GB), extract them.\n       * Else compute permutation_importance on the test set.\n   - Predictions:\n       * If predict_path is provided for supervised tasks, load and preprocess similarly (exclude target) and save predictions to outputs/predictions.csv.\n   - Save artifacts:\n       * Trained model (Pipeline) to outputs/model.pkl via joblib.\n       * Feature importances to outputs/feature_importances.csv.\n\n4) Unsupervised learning (when task is unsupervised):\n   - Preprocess X using the preprocessor (without y).\n   - Clustering:\n       * Evaluate KMeans for k in range(2, 10) with silhouette_score; pick best k and fit final KMeans.\n       * Save cluster labels to outputs/cluster_labels.csv (append to original data with a new column \"cluster\").\n   - Anomaly detection:\n       * Fit IsolationForest(random_state) and identify anomalies (score threshold based on decision_function; default contamination 0.05).\n       * Save anomalies to outputs/anomalies.csv (rows flagged as outliers).\n\n5) Reporting and logging:\n   - Produce a markdown report outputs/report.md including:\n       * Basic dataset info: shape, column types, missingness summary.\n       * Inferred/selected task and rationale.\n       * Preprocessing decisions.\n       * For supervised: model comparison summary (best params), test metrics, confusion matrix (for classification), and top features.\n       * For unsupervised: chosen k, silhouette score, brief cluster profiles (mean/std by numeric columns), anomaly count.\n       * Any warnings/exceptions captured.\n   - Log concise progress to console using Python logging.\n\n6) Code quality:\n   - Use clear functions:\n     * load_data(data_path)\n     * detect_task_and_target(df, user_target, task, id_cols)\n     * build_preprocessor(df, target_col, max_categories)\n     * run_supervised(X, y, task, test_size, random_state, n_jobs)\n     * run_unsupervised(X, random_state)\n     * save_report(...)\n   - Robust error handling: try/except around major steps, graceful fallbacks, and informative error messages.\n   - Ensure outputs directory exists (code/complex_dataset_analysis/outputs).\n   - Include a main guard if __name__ == \"__main__\": to parse args and execute.\n\n7) Dependencies:\n   - Use: pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, joblib. Avoid non-standard libs beyond these.\n   - At top, include a short comment block noting dependencies and example usage:\n     Example:\n       python code/complex_dataset_analysis/auto_problem_solver.py --data_path complex.csv --task auto\n\nDeliver a single complete Python file implementing all of the above, saved to code/complex_dataset_analysis/auto_problem_solver.py.",

The CSV has a header and month columns by year.\n   - Atmospheric CO2 (monthly) from NOAA Mauna Loa:\n     https://gml.noaa.gov/webdata/ccgg/trends/co2/co2_mm_mlo.csv\n     Use the seasonally adjusted series if present; otherwise use the monthly average column.\n\n2) Functionality:\n   - Download both datasets via HTTP (requests) with robust error handling (timeouts, retries; fallback if CO2 fetch fails proceed with temperature-only analysis).\n   - Parse NASA CSV by trimming to the table starting at the line beginning with \"Year\" and reshape to a tidy monthly time series (datetime index). \n   - Parse NOAA CO2 CSV, build a datetime index from year and month, and align with the temperature series.\n   - Restrict analysis focus to the most recent 10 full years available in the temperature dataset (e.g., last 120 months).\n   - Compute key metrics:\n       * Warming rate over the last 10 years in °C/decade using linear regression on monthly anomalies (report slope per decade and 95% CI using simple OLS assumptions).\n       * Monthly volatility (standard deviation) and autocorrelation at lag-1.\n       * Correlation between monthly anomalies and CO2 (Pearson), over the overlapping period.\n   - Modeling and forecasting:\n       * Build a simple forecasting model combining a linear trend with AR(1) residual correction (estimate AR(1) coefficient on residuals by least squares). \n       * Forecast the next 10 years monthly anomalies (120 steps) using this approach.\n       * Provide uncertainty bands using residual standard deviation (±1σ) around the forecast.\n   - Outputs:\n       * Save a CSV with the last 10 years historical data and the next 10 years forecasts: ./outputs/climate_forecast.csv \n         Columns: date, temp_anomaly_C (historical), forecast_anomaly_C (for future), lower_1sigma, upper_1sigma.\n       * Save a plot ./outputs/climate_forecast.png showing historical last 10 years plus forecast next 10 years with uncertainty bands and annotate the linear warming rate.\n       * Save a short text summary ./outputs/model_summary.txt that includes: data sources used, period covered, warming rate last decade (°C/decade) with CI, AR(1) coefficient, correlation with CO2, and forecast anomaly at +10 years.\n       * Print the same summary to stdout.\n\n3) Implementation details:\n   - Use only widely available libraries: requests, io, csv, pandas, numpy, scipy (only if available; otherwise compute CI using numpy formulas), matplotlib. Avoid heavy ML dependencies.\n   - Include helper functions for: fetching with retries; parsing each dataset; computing linear regression with CI; AR(1) estimation and forecast.\n   - Ensure reproducibility: set a fixed random seed where applicable (though this should be fully deterministic).\n   - Make the script robust to minor changes in upstream file formats (strip comments, ignore non-data rows, coerce missing values).\n   - Create the ./outputs directory if it doesn’t exist.\n   - In comments, cite the sources and baseline (NASA GISTEMP anomalies are relative to 1951–1980) and note that this is a simple statistical forecast, not a full Earth system model.\n\n4) Deliverables: A single executable Python file named climate_forecast.py that performs all steps above when run and produces the outputs.\n\nPlease write clean, well-commented code and ensure it runs end-to-end even if the CO2 dataset is unavailable (graceful degradation).",

The script should be self-contained, documented, and ready to run.\n\nFunctional requirements:\n1) Data and Training\n- Provide a function to download/load a public SMS spam dataset automatically if not present (use the well-known SMS spam TSV data from: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/justmarkham/scikit-learn-videos/master/data/sms.tsv). Save it under ./data/sms.tsv.\n- Preprocess text: lowercasing, basic punctuation/whitespace normalization. No heavy external resources (avoid requiring NLTK downloads).\n- Use scikit-learn pipeline: TfidfVectorizer (with English stop words, n-grams up to 2) + LogisticRegression (liblinear).\n- Split train/test set and print evaluation metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, F1, confusion matrix).\n- Save the trained model as a joblib file under ./models/scam_sms_filter.joblib. If the model exists, allow skipping training.\n\n2) Classification & Junk Marking\n- Provide a CLI command to classify messages from a CSV inbox file at a specified path. Assume the CSV has columns: id,text. The script should:\n  - Load the trained model (train if missing).\n  - Predict spam probabilities.\n  - Use a configurable threshold (default 0.5) to classify spam vs. ham.\n  - Output two CSVs: (a) a labeled copy of the inbox (id,text,label,prob_spam) and (b) a junk file containing only messages labeled as spam.\n- Also include a simple function classify_messages(messages: List[str]) -> List[Tuple[label, prob_spam]] for programmatic use.\n\n3) CLI & Structure\n- Use argparse with subcommands:\n  - train: trains the model (with optional --force to overwrite existing model).\n  - classify: classifies an inbox CSV (args: --inbox <path>, --out <path>, --junk <path>, --threshold <float>, --model <path default ./models/scam_sms_filter.joblib>).\n- Implement robust error handling: clear messages if files are missing, create ./data and ./models directories as needed, and validate inputs.\n- Add docstrings and comments explaining usage and the junk marking process.\n\n4) Dependencies\n- Use only standard library + scikit-learn, pandas, numpy, joblib, requests. Include a top-of-file comment with installation instructions: `pip install scikit-learn pandas numpy joblib requests`.\n\n5) Security/Safety Notes\n- Include a comment noting that the model may produce false positives/negatives and that users should review junk messages before deletion.\n\n6) Example Usage (in comments)\n- Show typical commands:\n  - python scam_sms_filter.py train\n  - python scam_sms_filter.py classify --inbox ./inbox.csv --out ./inbox_labeled.csv --junk ./junk.csv --threshold 0.6\n\nCoding style:\n- Clear functions: download_dataset(), load_dataset(), build_pipeline(), train_and_evaluate(), save_model(), load_model(), classify_inbox_csv(), classify_messages().\n- Main entry point with if __name__ == \"__main__\": that wires argparse and subcommands.\n- Keep file within ~1500 tokens while remaining readable and complete.\n",

Requirements:\n\n1) Core behavior:\n- Use psutil to monitor CPU usage of the target process and all its children, computing a smoothed moving average over recent samples.\n- Provide CLI options via argparse to either:\n  a) --cmd \"<command with args>\" to launch a program and optimize it; or\n  b) --pid <PID> to attach to an existing process.\n- Allow configuration of:\n  - --target-percent (default 40): desired approximate CPU usage percent; used to define low/high thresholds with hysteresis.\n  - --high-threshold (default target+10) and --low-threshold (default target-10).\n  - --interval (default 1.0s): sampling interval.\n  - --window (default 5): moving average window size in samples.\n  - --grace-samples (default 3): number of consecutive samples beyond threshold before adjusting.\n  - --min-cores (default 1) and --max-cores (default: all logical cores): used for adjusting CPU affinity on supported OSes.\n  - --nice-min and --nice-max for Unix niceness bounds (default 0..19); Windows uses priority classes mapping instead.\n  - --emergency-threshold (default target+30): if exceeded for grace-samples, apply emergency throttling (Unix only) using brief SIGSTOP/SIGCONT bursts.\n  - --dry-run to log intended actions without applying changes.\n  - --log-level (INFO/DEBUG) and --log-file optional.\n- Adjustments:\n  - If usage > high-threshold for grace-samples:\n    1) Increase niceness (Unix) or lower priority class (Windows) toward configured max.\n    2) Reduce CPU affinity by limiting cores, not going below min-cores.\n  - If usage < low-threshold for grace-samples:\n    1) Decrease niceness (Unix) or raise priority class (Windows) toward configured min.\n    2) Expand CPU affinity up to max-cores.\n- Ensure hysteresis: do not oscillate too rapidly; use the smoothed average and grace-samples.\n- Emergency throttling (Unix only): if usage exceeds emergency-threshold and already at max niceness and min cores, send SIGSTOP for a short duration (e.g., 100ms) then SIGCONT, at most once per N intervals; make this configurable and safe.\n\n2) OS-specific handling:\n- Detect platform (Linux/Windows/macOS). For macOS, CPU affinity may be unsupported; skip gracefully.\n- Priority handling:\n  - Unix: use psutil.Process.nice() to set niceness (clamped).\n  - Windows: map to priority classes (IDLE, BELOW_NORMAL, NORMAL, ABOVE_NORMAL, HIGH, REALTIME), but never use REALTIME; clamp within safe bounds; default range BELOW_NORMAL..HIGH.\n- CPU affinity:\n  - Use psutil.Process.cpu_affinity() on platforms where available (Linux/Windows). On others, log a warning and skip.\n\n3) Safety and robustness:\n- Catch psutil.AccessDenied, psutil.NoSuchProcess, and OSError; log and continue or exit gracefully.\n- Restore original priority and affinity on exit (when possible), including child processes.\n- If attaching by PID, validate it exists and is accessible; if launching, capture subprocess Popen and its PID; handle termination and cleanup.\n- Aggregate CPU percent across child processes; recheck the process tree periodically.\n- Provide clear logs for each adjustment decision and action.\n\n4) CLI Examples in the docstring and --help:\n- Launch and optimize: python cpu_usage_optimizer.py --cmd \"python heavy_script.py --epochs 50\" --target-percent 35\n- Attach to PID: python cpu_usage_optimizer.py --pid 12345 --target-percent 50 --interval 0.5 --min-cores 2\n\n5) Implementation notes:\n- Use a class CPUUsageOptimizer to encapsulate logic; methods for monitor loop, measure_usage, adjust_priority, adjust_affinity, emergency_throttle, and restore.\n- Use signal handling to ensure cleanup on SIGINT/SIGTERM.\n- Use time.monotonic() for intervals; use deque for moving average.\n- Use logging with timestamps; optionally write to a file if --log-file is provided.\n- Make sure operations that require admin privileges log actionable advice when AccessDenied occurs.\n\nProduce a single, runnable Python script with robust comments and docstrings that meets these requirements.",

Produce an optimized version that preserves the same public function signatures and behavior, but significantly improves performance using vectorization and parallel programming. Apply the following guidelines:\n\nCore goals:\n- Replace Python-level loops with NumPy vectorization and broadcasting wherever possible.\n- Use Numba @njit (nopython=True) for hot numeric routines; enable parallel=True and prange when safe and beneficial.\n- For tasks that are hard to vectorize, use chunked parallel processing via concurrent.futures.ProcessPoolExecutor, with careful memory handling (avoid pickling huge arrays unnecessarily, prefer shared memory or passing views/chunk indices).\n- Maintain numerical stability and deterministic behavior unless explicitly documented (e.g., parallel reductions may change summation order; use pairwise or Kahan summation if required). If determinism is important for a given function, keep a deterministic path.\n- Ensure all arrays use consistent dtypes (e.g., float64) and C-contiguous layout when needed; preallocate outputs; avoid repeated allocations inside loops.\n- Avoid unnecessary copies (use views, out=, keepdims= when relevant).\n- Where appropriate, replace manual linear algebra with np.dot, np.einsum, or scipy.linalg functions.\n- Use broadcasting, advanced indexing, vectorized ufuncs, and aggregations (np.sum, np.mean, np.maximum, np.where, np.clip).\n- Include input validation, clear docstrings, and type hints. Keep the API backward compatible.\n- Add a configuration flag to toggle parallelization and a graceful fallback when numba is not installed. Don’t crash if numba is missing.\n- Include small benchmarking helpers (optional) guarded under __main__ or a function, without affecting the module footprint.\n\nImplementation details and examples to consider (adapt to the actual functions found in the source):\n- Distance matrix or pairwise computations: vectorize via broadcasting or use scipy.spatial.distance.cdist, or Numba with prange and cache-friendly iteration.\n- Monte Carlo simulations: vectorize random draws with NumPy; for path-dependent parts, use Numba loops with parallel=True and preallocated arrays.\n- Convolutions/filters: use scipy.signal or NumPy strides; or Numba with stencil-like loops.\n- Polynomial or elementwise transforms: use ufuncs; avoid Python for-loops.\n- Reductions: use np.sum/np.mean with dtype control; for parallel reductions with Numba, consider pairwise strategy to reduce error.\n\nStructure:\n- Keep the same public functions and their parameters.\n- Add internal helpers with Numba JIT (guarded by try/except import numba), e.g., _fast_op_jit(...), and automatically select between JIT/vectorized and pure NumPy paths.\n- Add optional parameters like use_numba: bool = True and use_parallel: bool = True with sensible defaults; but do not break existing signatures—use **kwargs or internal config if needed.\n- Provide comprehensive docstrings for each public function describing performance options and expected shapes/dtypes.\n- Include basic tests/bench runner (e.g., run_bench()) that demonstrates speedup on synthetic data without external frameworks.\n\nNotes:\n- Keep external dependencies limited to NumPy, optional Numba, and optional SciPy if already implied by the original code. Prefer not to introduce heavyweight new dependencies.\n- Ensure Windows/Linux/macOS compatibility; avoid relying on fork-only semantics.\n- Adhere to PEP 8 and provide readable, maintainable code with comments explaining optimization choices.\n\nUsing the above, refactor the provided heavy_numeric_computations.py into an optimized variant. Preserve the module’s behavior and return types. Where exact behavior of the original code suggests constraints (e.g., order of operations, specific edge-case handling), keep them. If any function is inherently I/O bound, leave it as-is and document why vectorization/parallelization may not help.\n\nIf present APIs include or resemble:\n- compute_pairwise_distances(X: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray\n- simulate_paths(n_paths: int, n_steps: int, params: dict) -> np.ndarray\n- transform_series(data: np.ndarray, coeffs: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray\nthen optimize them accordingly.\n\nAdd at top:\n- A module-level docstring summarizing optimization approach and usage.\n- A safe import block for numba, setting a flag HAS_NUMBA.\n- Configuration dataclass OptimizationConfig to control parallelization and precision options.\n\nEnsure the final file is a drop-in replacement for the original module under typical usage, but provides performance improvements out-of-the-box. Include a small __main__ section to demo and benchmark, but keep it short.\n",
