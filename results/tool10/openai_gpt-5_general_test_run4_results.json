Priorities: reliability, maintainability, observability, and fast iteration.\n\nHigh-level architecture:\n- Client layer: SSR/SSG-capable web app for fast first paint and SEO. Progressive enhancement on the client; hydrate rich interactions. CDN in front for static assets and edge caching.\n- Edge: CDN + WAF + TLS termination, rate limiting, bot filtering, and edge redirects/rewrites. Optional edge functions for simple personalization and A/B assignment.\n- API gateway/BFF: Single entry for web clients. Adapts backend services to web-optimized payloads. Handles auth, request shaping, caching, and schema stitching if using multiple services.\n- Core services (start as a modular monolith while boundaries are clearly defined; evolve to services as needed):\n  1) Identity & Access (AuthN/Z): user registration, login (email/password + social login), session/JWT, roles & permissions, MFA, password reset, SSO (OIDC/OAuth2).\n  2) Content Service (CMS): pages, posts, categories, tags, media linking, draft/publish workflow, versioning.\n  3) Catalog & Order (optional e-commerce): products, variants, inventory, cart, checkout, orders, payments, refunds, taxes, shipping.\n  4) Search: full-text and faceted search across content and catalog.\n  5) Media: upload, transform, store, and serve images/videos with responsive variants.\n  6) Notifications: email, in-app, and optional SMS/push; templating and preferences.\n  7) Admin: dashboards for content, users, settings, and moderation.\n- Data layer: Primary relational DB for transactional data; cache for hot paths; object storage for media; search index for discovery; message queue for async work; analytics/warehouse for BI.\n- Async processing: workers for emails, image processing, webhooks, search indexing, and long-running tasks.\n- Observability: central logs, metrics, traces, dashboards, and alerting.\n- Environments: dev → staging → prod, with isolated resources.\n- Deployment: containerized services with IaC. Blue/green or rolling deploys, feature flags, and schema migrations.\n\nDatabase design (relational core, e.g., PostgreSQL):\n- Users(id PK, email UNIQUE, email_verified, password_hash, name, avatar_url, mfa_enabled, created_at, updated_at)\n- Roles(id PK, name UNIQUE)\n- UserRoles(user_id FK Users, role_id FK Roles, PK(user_id, role_id))\n- Permissions(id PK, key UNIQUE)\n- RolePermissions(role_id FK Roles, permission_id FK Permissions, PK(role_id, permission_id))\n- Sessions(id PK, user_id FK Users, refresh_token UNIQUE, ip, user_agent, expires_at, created_at)\n- Content:\n  - Pages(id PK, slug UNIQUE, title, status ENUM[draft,scheduled,published,archived], author_id FK Users, published_at, created_at, updated_at)\n  - PageBlocks(id PK, page_id FK Pages, type, json_content JSONB, position INT)\n  - Media(id PK, owner_id FK Users, url, alt_text, width, height, mime_type, size_bytes, checksum, created_at)\n  - Tags(id PK, name UNIQUE)\n  - PageTags(page_id FK Pages, tag_id FK Tags, PK(page_id, tag_id))\n  - Revisions(id PK, entity_type, entity_id, diff JSONB, editor_id FK Users, created_at)\n- SearchIndex(queue-based backfill + triggers): maintained in external search store; keep SearchTasks(id, entity_type, entity_id, op, created_at, status)\n- Notifications:\n  - NotificationTemplates(id PK, key UNIQUE, channel ENUM[email,in_app,sms], subject, body_mjml, created_at)\n  - Notifications(id PK, user_id FK Users, template_key, payload JSONB, status ENUM[pending,sent,failed], created_at, sent_at)\n  - NotificationPreferences(user_id FK Users, channel, enabled BOOL, PK(user_id, channel))\n- E-commerce (optional):\n  - Products(id PK, sku UNIQUE, name, description, price_cents, currency, status, created_at, updated_at)\n  - ProductVariants(id PK, product_id FK Products, sku UNIQUE, options JSONB, price_cents, inventory_qty)\n  - Carts(id PK, user_id FK Users NULLABLE, session_id UNIQUE NULLABLE, created_at, updated_at)\n  - CartItems(id PK, cart_id FK Carts, product_variant_id FK ProductVariants, qty)\n  - Orders(id PK, user_id FK Users, status, total_cents, currency, payment_id, placed_at)\n  - OrderItems(id PK, order_id FK Orders, product_variant_id FK ProductVariants, qty, price_cents)\n- Admin & Audit:\n  - AuditLogs(id PK, actor_id FK Users, action, entity_type, entity_id, metadata JSONB, created_at)\n  - Webhooks(id PK, target_url, event_key, secret, active)\n  - WebhookDeliveries(id PK, webhook_id FK Webhooks, payload JSONB, status, attempts, last_attempt_at)\n\nIndexes & performance:\n- B-tree indexes on foreign keys; partial index on Pages(status='published'); GIN indexes on JSONB fields accessed frequently; trigram or full-text index for search fields; composite indexes for common filters (e.g., (page_id, position)). Use row-level security for multi-tenant scenarios, if needed.\n- Caching: Redis for session cache (if not using stateless), page fragment cache, CDN edge cache with cache tags/purges on publish.\n\nData flows:\n- Publish flow: author saves draft → preview via tokenized URL → publish triggers cache purge, search indexing, and CDN invalidation.\n- Media flow: upload → virus scan → store to object storage → generate responsive variants → update Media.\n- Order flow (if enabled): cart → checkout → payment intent → webhook confirms → finalize Order → send notifications.\n\nSecurity:\n- HTTPS everywhere, HSTS, CSP, CSRF protection, secure cookies, JWT rotation, password hashing (Argon2id), rate limiting, IP allowlist for admin, secrets manager, regular dependency scans, SAST/DAST.\n\nScalability:\n- Start with a modular monolith with clear domain modules. Horizontal scale stateless web/API, scale DB vertically then read replicas, scale Redis and search clusters as usage grows. Partition background jobs by queue.\n",

The script must be saved to code/complex_dataset_analysis/auto_solver.py and implement the following requirements:\n\nHigh-level goals:\n- Automatically determine the most appropriate task (classification, regression, clustering, or anomaly detection) based on the dataset or user input, then preprocess data, train models, evaluate, and produce artifacts.\n- Provide a CLI to control behavior, with sensible defaults that work out-of-the-box on complex.csv.\n- Be resilient to mixed data types: numeric, categorical, datetime, and free-text columns.\n\nCLI and execution:\n- Use argparse to support:\n  --data_path (default: \"complex.csv\")\n  --output_dir (default: \"code/complex_dataset_analysis\")\n  --target (optional): name of target column; if omitted, attempt auto-detection\n  --task (optional): one of {auto, classification, regression, clustering, anomaly}; default auto\n  --test_path (optional): path to a second CSV to run predictions on if supervised\n  --max_rows (optional): limit rows loaded for memory safety; default None\n  --random_state (optional): default 42\n- Main entry point should be guarded by if __name__ == \"__main__\": and orchestrate end-to-end execution.\n\nData loading and type inference:\n- Load CSV with pandas; support --max_rows for partial loading.\n- Infer column types and split into groups:\n  - numeric: floats/ints\n  - categorical: low-cardinality object columns (e.g., unique values <= 200)\n  - text: high-cardinality object columns (e.g., unique values > 200 or average token length > 3)\n  - datetime: parseable date/time columns (attempt pandas.to_datetime with errors='coerce').\n- For datetime columns, generate features: year, month, day, dayofweek, hour (if present); drop original datetime after feature expansion.\n\nTarget detection and task selection (auto mode):\n- If --target provided, use it. Otherwise, attempt to discover a target column by checking common names: ['target','label','y','output','class'] or the last column if it appears to be a target.\n- If a target is found:\n  - If target is categorical (object or numeric with few unique values, e.g., <= 20), choose classification.\n  - Else choose regression.\n- If no target is found:\n  - Run unsupervised: perform both clustering (KMeans) and anomaly detection (IsolationForest).\n\nPreprocessing pipelines:\n- Handle missing values:\n  - numeric: SimpleImputer(strategy='median')\n  - categorical: SimpleImputer(strategy='most_frequent') + OneHotEncoder(handle_unknown='ignore')\n  - text: TfidfVectorizer (limit features to e.g., max_features=5000; handle stop_words='english')\n  - For numeric, optionally apply StandardScaler.\n- Use ColumnTransformer to combine numeric, categorical, and text pipelines. Ensure text columns pass through a custom transformer that handles TF-IDF per text column (e.g., FunctionTransformer/Pipeline or a small custom class that vectorizes each text column then concatenates).\n- Ensure all pipelines are compatible with scikit-learn fit/transform.\n\nModel selection:\n- Classification: HistGradientBoostingClassifier with class_weight='balanced' when applicable.\n- Regression: HistGradientBoostingRegressor.\n- Clustering: KMeans (n_clusters auto-chosen via a simple heuristic, e.g., elbow or default 8 with optional silhouette evaluation).\n- Anomaly detection: IsolationForest.\n\nEvaluation:\n- Split supervised tasks into train/test using train_test_split (e.g., test_size=0.2).\n- Metrics:\n  - classification: accuracy, macro F1; if binary, also ROC-AUC (guard for probability availability)\n  - regression: RMSE, MAE, R2\n  - clustering: silhouette score (sample if dataset is large)\n  - anomaly: report top-N anomaly scores and percentage flagged\n- Use cross_val_score if feasible for a quick sanity check (cv=3) when dataset size permits (guard for speed).\n\nOutputs and artifacts (write to output_dir):\n- Save a summary report (report.md) describing:\n  - task selected\n  - data overview (row/column counts, type counts)\n  - preprocessing steps\n  - model chosen and key hyperparameters\n  - metrics and findings\n- Save metrics.json for structured metric output.\n- Supervised: If --test_path provided, generate predictions.csv using the fitted pipeline+model.\n- Unsupervised:\n  - Save clustering assignments to clusters.csv (data index and cluster label)\n  - Save anomaly scores and flags to anomalies.csv (data index, score, is_anomaly)\n- Save the fitted pipeline+model to model.joblib using joblib.\n- Create the output directory if it does not exist.\n\nEngineering and robustness:\n- Implement clear functions: load_data, infer_column_types, build_preprocessor, detect_task, build_model, evaluate_supervised, run_unsupervised, save_artifacts, generate_report.\n- Add logging with the logging module (INFO-level); print concise progress updates.\n- Use try/except around critical steps and log exceptions gracefully.\n- Ensure random_state is applied where relevant.\n- Guard against edge cases: entirely missing columns, constant columns, extremely high cardinality categorical columns, empty datasets, missing target column.\n- Keep external dependencies limited to: pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, scipy (optional), joblib. Avoid heavy external libs.\n\nNotes:\n- The script should be immediately runnable after saving: python code/complex_dataset_analysis/auto_solver.py --data_path complex.csv --task auto\n- Default behavior: auto-detect task, train/evaluate, and write artifacts under code/complex_dataset_analysis.\n- Write clean, readable, well-commented code.\n",

Fit on last 10 years.\n   - Baseline temperature model: SARIMAX without exogenous to provide a benchmark.\n   - CO2 model: Use Holt’s linear trend (ExponentialSmoothing with trend='add') to forecast the next 10 years monthly.\n   - Also fit a simple climate-sensitivity regression: temp_anomaly ~ alpha * ln(CO2) + beta on the last 10 years; use this with the CO2 forecast to produce a second temperature forecast pathway.\n\n4) Forecasting:\n   - Produce 10-year-ahead monthly forecasts (120 steps) for:\n     a) Temperature (SARIMAX with ln(CO2) exogenous using CO2 forecast as the exog path).\n     b) Temperature baseline (SARIMAX without exog).\n     c) CO2 (Holt trend).\n   - Compute recent test performance for temperature using a 24-month holdout (RMSE and MAE) for the SARIMAX models.\n\n5) Outputs:\n   - Save forecasts to output/forecasts.csv with columns: date, temp_forecast_exog, temp_forecast_baseline, co2_forecast_ppm.\n   - Generate and save plots to output/plots.png showing:\n     - Historical temperature anomalies (last 10 years) and both forecasts.\n     - Historical CO2 and forecast.\n   - Write a textual summary to output/forecast_summary.txt including:\n     - Data coverage and sources used.\n     - Model specs and test metrics.\n     - Key quantitative findings: last-10-year linear trend in temperature anomaly (°C/decade), CO2 trend (ppm/year), and the forecast ranges for 2030–2035 monthly anomalies.\n     - Assumptions and caveats.\n   - Print the same summary to stdout.\n\n6) Engineering:\n   - Use robust error handling and logging; if one data source fails, print a clear message and exit gracefully.\n   - Ensure the script creates an output/ directory if absent.\n   - Avoid exotic dependencies; rely on pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, statsmodels.\n   - Use clear function structure: fetch_temperature(), fetch_co2(), process_data(), fit_models(), forecast(), make_plots(), write_summary().\n   - Make code reproducible with a fixed random seed; time operations based on pandas Periods/Datetimes.\n\n7) Edge cases and details:\n   - NASA GISTEMP CSV parsing: columns include Year and Jan..Dec. Melt to monthly with a proper DateTime index. Values may include \"***\" or missing; coerce to numeric and drop NaNs.\n   - NOAA CO2 CSV parsing: lines start with '#'; use comment='#' in read_csv. Columns include year, month, decimal_date, average, interpolated, trend, days; select 'trend'.\n   - Use the latest available month in both datasets; define analysis window as last 120 months.\n   - When combining: exogenous ln(CO2) = np.log(co2_ppm). Align by date.\n   - Evaluation: Fit on training period (last 120 - 24 months), forecast over the holdout, compute RMSE and MAE vs actuals for models with and without exog.\n   - Forecast horizon: 120 months ahead; for exogenous SARIMAX, pass ln(CO2) forecast as exog path.\n\n8) Final behavior:\n   - On successful run, the script prints and saves a concise summary with numbers, and stores forecasts.csv and plots.png under output/.\n   - If any data download or modeling step fails, include the error message in forecast_summary.txt and print it.\n",

Target 100-player matches, 20–25 minute session length, solo/duo/squad modes. Key features: airdrop insertion from transport aircraft, randomized shrinking safe zone, tiered loot (Common/Rare/Epic/Legendary), weapons classes (AR/SMG/LMG/Sniper/Shotgun/Pistol), armor/helmet tiers, healing items, throwable utilities, vehicles (jeep/truck/quad), supply drops, buyback respawn tokens, and contracts/bounties for mid-game objectives. Technical constraints: 60 FPS, UE5 with World Partition/Nanite/Lumen, Chaos Physics/Destruction, Enhanced Input, GAS (Gameplay Ability System) for abilities/perks, dedicated authoritative servers with efficient replication/relevancy, server tick ~30, client tick ~60. Level design: combine open-field assets and urban POIs to form a 4x4–8x8 km map; ensure sightlines, verticality, cover density, and traversal; use sublevels and streaming for performance; implement navmesh for AI/bots. Balance considerations: spawn/loot distribution fairness, risk/reward zones, rotation paths, pacing, and third-party risk in urban clusters. Provide actionable strategies for environment utilization, player flow, resource distribution, gameplay balance, engagement, and technical optimization tuned to these assets."

Combine with a custom FeatureUnion/ColumnTransformer adding regex-based features and metadata.\n  - Provide probability/decision scores and thresholding (default threshold tuned on validation).\n\n- Heuristic fallback (no model file available):\n  - Use compiled regex for patterns common in scams: e.g., \"urgent\", \"verify\", \"account locked\", \"click (here|link)\", \"free\", \"winner\", \"claim\", \"gift card\", \"bitcoin|crypto\", \"reset password\", \"delivery failed\", \"pay now\", \"OTP\", short URLs (bit.ly, tinyurl, t.co), money amounts, suspicious phone prompts.\n  - Compute a risk score based on keyword hits, number of URLs/emails/phones, message length extremes, and uppercase ratio.\n  - Classify as junk if risk score exceeds a threshold.\n\n- CLI (argparse):\n  - Train: python scam_sms_filter.py --train data.csv --model model.joblib [--test_size 0.2]\n  - Predict: python scam_sms_filter.py --predict input.csv --model model.joblib --out output.csv\n  - Predict raw strings: python scam_sms_filter.py --predict-lines \"Your account is locked, click here\" \"Free gift card\"\n  - Optional: --junk-dir junk/ to write junk messages as .txt files, or default to junk_messages.csv.\n\n- Reliability:\n  - No external network calls. Use only standard library + numpy + pandas + scikit-learn + joblib.\n  - Graceful error handling if dependencies are missing; print guidance to install.\n  - Deterministic seeds for reproducibility.\n  - Clear logging of steps and metrics.\n\n- Provide a __main__ block demonstrating usage and wiring CLI to functions.\n- Keep code within ~1500 tokens.\n- Ensure the script is self-contained in a single file and easy to run.\n",

            "prompt": "Write a robust Python 3 command-line tool named \"CPU Optimizer\" that optimizes the CPU usage of a given program by dynamically adjusting process priority (niceness) and CPU affinity, keeping the program near a target CPU utilization. The tool should be cross-platform where possible (Linux, Windows, macOS), and degrade gracefully where features are unavailable.\n\nRequirements and behavior:\n\n1) CLI Arguments (use argparse):\n   - Mutually exclusive inputs:\n     * --pid PID (int): attach to an existing process by PID\n     * --cmd CMD (string): command to execute (e.g., \"python heavy_script.py\")\n   - --target TARGET (int, default 70): desired CPU usage percentage (1-100)\n   - --interval SECONDS (float, default 0.5): monitoring interval\n   - --min-cores (int, default 1): minimum CPU cores allowed\n   - --max-cores (int, default: total logical cores): maximum CPU cores allowed\n   - --hysteresis PCT (int, default 5): hysteresis band to prevent oscillation; actions trigger if usage exceeds target ± hysteresis\n   - --cooldown SECONDS (float, default 2.0): minimum time between successive adjustments\n   - --dry-run (flag): print planned adjustments without applying\n   - --log-level (string, default \"info\"): one of \"debug\", \"info\", \"warning\", \"error\"\n\n2) Cross-platform considerations:\n   - Use psutil extensively.\n   - Niceness/priority:\n     * Linux/macOS: psutil.Process.nice() using integer nice levels (range -20..19). Start from current nice, increase when above target (lower priority), decrease when below target (raise priority); clamp to safe range (-10..10) by default.\n     * Windows: use psutil priority classes (e.g., psutil.BELOW_NORMAL_PRIORITY_CLASS, psutil.NORMAL_PRIORITY_CLASS, psutil.ABOVE_NORMAL_PRIORITY_CLASS). Map to steps similar to niceness adjustments.\n   - CPU affinity:\n     * Linux/Windows: use psutil.Process.cpu_affinity() to set allowed cores. Reduce by one core when above target; increase by one when below target. Keep within [min_cores, max_cores].\n     * macOS: psutil does not support setting affinity; detect platform and skip affinity changes with a warning.\n\n3) Monitoring logic:\n   - Track aggregate CPU usage of the target process including its children. Implement a helper that sums psutil.Process.cpu_percent(interval=None) across process + descendants.\n   - Normalize CPU percent to a per-system basis (psutil.cpu_count(logical=True)) for meaningful comparison. For example, if aggregate > target + hysteresis, apply throttling steps.\n   - Also consider system-wide load (psutil.cpu_percent(interval=0.0)); if the system is busy (>85%), avoid increasing priority or cores even if below target.\n\n4) Control strategy:\n   - Maintain baseline state of original niceness/priority and affinity to restore on exit.\n   - When CPU > target + hysteresis:\n     * Increase niceness (Linux/macOS) or move to lower priority class (Windows). Step size: 1 on Linux/macOS; one class step on Windows.\n     * Reduce affinity by 1 core down to min_cores (if supported).\n   - When CPU < target - hysteresis and system load is not high:\n     * Decrease niceness (Linux/macOS) or move to higher priority class (Windows) towards baseline.\n     * Increase affinity by 1 core up to max_cores (if supported).\n   - Enforce cooldown time between successive adjustments to prevent rapid oscillations.\n\n5) Environment threads for launched commands:\n   - If launching a command (not attaching to PID), set environment variables OMP_NUM_THREADS, OPENBLAS_NUM_THREADS, MKL_NUM_THREADS to the current allowed core count when starting; update is not required during runtime.\n\n6) Safety and robustness:\n   - Validate inputs and clamp values (e.g., target 1..100, min-cores >= 1, max-cores <= total logical cores, min-cores <= max-cores).\n   - Catch and log exceptions for permission errors (e.g., setting affinity/nice may require elevated privileges). Continue running if adjustments fail.\n   - Handle process termination gracefully; if the target exits, stop monitoring.\n   - Implement SIGINT/SIGTERM handlers to restore original settings on exit. On Windows, handle KeyboardInterrupt and normal exit.\n\n7) Logging:\n   - Use logging module with levels; default info.\n   - Log each iteration: measured CPU (aggregate and system), current cores allowed, current nice/priority, and any adjustments made.\n   - In dry-run mode, show intended adjustments but do not apply.\n\n8) Structure and functions:\n   - main() for argument parsing and top-level orchestration.\n   - find_or_launch_process(args) -> psutil.Process, popen_obj or None, initial_allowed_cores\n   - get_process_tree(process) -> list of psutil.Process (process + descendants)\n   - measure_cpu_usage(process) -> float percent (aggregate normalized to [0, 100])\n   - adjust_niceness_or_priority(process, direction, state, dry_run) -> updates state with new nice/priority\n   - adjust_affinity(process, direction, state, dry_run) -> updates state with new allowed cores\n   - restore_original_settings(process, state)\n   - platform detection helpers: is_windows(), is_macos(), is_linux()\n\n9) CLI usage examples included in the module docstring:\n   - Launching a command: python cpu_optimizer.py --cmd \"python heavy_script.py\" --target 60 --interval 0.5\n   - Attaching to a PID: python cpu_optimizer.py --pid 1234 --target 50 --min-cores 2 --max-cores 8\n   - Dry run: python cpu_optimizer.py --pid 1234 --dry-run --log-level debug\n\n10) Dependencies:\n   - psutil (document requirement and include a quick pip install note)\n\n11) Implementation notes:\n   - Use try/finally to ensure restoration of original niceness/priority and affinity.\n   - On Windows, use a prioritized list of classes: [IDLE_PRIORITY_CLASS, BELOW_NORMAL_PRIORITY_CLASS, NORMAL_PRIORITY_CLASS, ABOVE_NORMAL_PRIORITY_CLASS, HIGH_PRIORITY_CLASS]. Do not use REALTIME.\n   - Niceness clamp: baseline within [-10, 10] by default; allow adjusting within that range.\n   - Affinity adjustments apply to the main process; child processes may inherit affinity, but scatter cases are acceptable.\n\n12) Provide clear, commented code, with docstrings explaining the approach and limitations.\n\nCreate the file as a standalone Python script with a if __name__ == \"__main__\": guard. Ensure it runs even if only --pid or --cmd is provided and prints meaningful messages.\n",

            "prompt": "You are optimizing an existing Python module named `heavy_numeric_computations.py`. Use it as context and produce an optimized version focusing on vectorization and parallel programming while preserving all public function names and signatures. Where a function’s interface cannot be inferred, keep the same name and parameters but improve internals.\n\nGoals and constraints:\n- Replace Python loops and per-element operations with NumPy vectorized operations and broadcasting when feasible.\n- For compute-intensive loops that are not easily expressible via pure vectorization, implement Numba JIT (`@njit`) with `parallel=True` and `prange` to parallelize safe loops.\n- For embarrassingly parallel tasks across independent chunks or parameter sweeps, add a parallel execution path using `concurrent.futures.ProcessPoolExecutor` (stdlib) or `multiprocessing`. Ensure cross-platform safety with `if __name__ == \"__main__\":` guards for executable entry points.\n- Add an optional `n_workers` argument (defaulting to available CPU count) for parallel routines and chunking logic to cap memory usage.\n- Prefer memory-efficient patterns: preallocation, in-place operations where safe, avoid unnecessary copies, use views, and leverage dtypes explicitly (e.g., `np.float64`).\n- Keep the public API intact: do not change function names or their signatures; only optimize internals. If the original code exposes a CLI or main routine, preserve it while improving performance.\n- Add clear docstrings/comments summarizing the optimization strategy and any mathematical equivalences used. Keep error handling intact.\n- Provide a graceful fallback when Numba is unavailable (try/except import); continue with the NumPy-optimized path without failing.\n- Avoid new heavy external dependencies. Only use: Python stdlib, NumPy, optional Numba. No pandas or SciPy unless already present in the original file.\n- Maintain deterministic results. If randomness is used, allow passing a seed parameter through the existing API or preserve current seeding.\n- Include a small `__main__` self-test/demo that runs representative functions on synthetic data to show speedups (guarded under `if __name__ == '__main__':`).\n\nImplementation directions:\n- Identify hotspots in the original module: tight Python loops over arrays, nested loops over indices, repeated conversions, redundant allocations. Replace with:\n  - Broadcasting, vectorized arithmetic, reductions (`np.sum`, `np.mean`, `np.dot`, `np.einsum` when appropriate).\n  - `np.where`, boolean masks, and advanced indexing for conditional logic instead of per-element `if`s.\n  - `np.linalg` routines where appropriate for linear algebra.\n- For non-vectorizable operations:\n  - Extract kernels into separate functions decorated with `@njit(parallel=True, fastmath=False)` and use `prange` for outer loops. Document assumptions (no Python objects, fixed dtypes).\n  - Ensure inputs to Numba functions are `np.ndarray` with concrete dtypes; avoid object arrays.\n- Parallel execution path:\n  - Create helper utilities to chunk large arrays or parameter grids, dispatch chunks to processes, and reduce/concatenate results.\n  - Provide `n_workers` and `chunk_size` parameters; default `n_workers` to `os.cpu_count()` or 1 when None; choose chunk sizes to balance overhead.\n  - Ensure functions remain usable serially (e.g., `n_workers=1` uses single-thread path).\n- Memory efficiency:\n  - Preallocate output arrays once and fill in-place.\n  - Use views/slices rather than copies where possible.\n  - Avoid building large Python lists; operate in NumPy space.\n\nDocumentation:\n- Add top-level comments summarizing major changes and how to toggle parallel paths.\n- Keep type hints where present; otherwise add minimal type hints to clarify array shapes/dtypes.\n\nPreserve any original behavior and results while making the code faster. If any API detail cannot be resolved from context, keep the same signature and return semantics.\n\nFinally, output a single optimized Python module with the same public functions and a short demo block under `if __name__ == '__main__':` that compares the original style vs optimized style on sample data and prints timing comparisons.\n",

For user transparency, include a short header comment noting that the program was generated using the Grok-3 model.\n\nProblem setup:\n- Number of qubits n = 6.\n- Constraint: exactly K = 2 qubits must be in the |1> state (Hamming weight equals K). Only configurations satisfying this constraint are considered valid. Others have amplitude 0.\n- Energy function E(x) = sum_i h[i] * x[i], where x[i] in {0,1} and:\n  h = [0.8, 0.1, 1.7, -1.5, 0.3, -0.9]\n- Phase function phi(x) = sum_i phi[i] * x[i], with:\n  phi = [0.2, -0.4, 1.1, 0.7, -0.3, 0.5]\n- Amplitude definition for a valid bitstring x with Hamming weight K:\n    amp(x) = exp(-E(x)/2) / sqrt(Z) * exp(i * phi(x))\n  where the normalization constant Z = sum over all valid x (exp(-E(x))).\n- Probability definition: p(x) = |amp(x)|^2.\n\nComputations to perform:\n1) Enumerate all valid states to compute Z.\n2) For a target state x_target = \"101000\" (MSB is qubit 0), compute and print:\n   - The complex amplitude amp(x_target) with both real and imaginary parts.\n   - The probability p(x_target).\n3) Use simulated annealing to find the state that maximizes p(x) under the constraint (equivalently minimizes E(x)). Requirements:\n   - Start from a random valid state with RNG seed set to 42.\n   - Propose neighbors that preserve Hamming weight K by swapping one 1->0 and one 0->1 bit.\n   - Temperature schedule: T0 = 5.0, cooling rate alpha = 0.995, steps = 20000.\n   - Use the Metropolis acceptance rule on the energy difference (since p ∝ exp(-E)).\n   - Track and print the best state found, its energy, its probability, and its amplitude.\n\nProgram structure:\n- Use only the Python standard library (math, random, itertools, typing).\n- Provide helper functions:\n  - hamming_weight(x: list[int]) -> int\n  - is_valid(x: list[int]) -> bool\n  - energy(x: list[int]) -> float\n  - phase(x: list[int]) -> float\n  - enumerate_valid_states() -> list[list[int]]\n  - normalization_Z(valid_states) -> float\n  - amplitude(x, Z) -> complex\n  - probability(x, Z) -> float\n  - to_bitstring(x) -> str\n  - propose_neighbor_same_weight(x, rng) -> list[int]\n  - simulated_annealing(Z) -> tuple(list[int], float)\n\n- In main():\n  - Build valid states, compute Z.\n  - Compute amplitude and probability for x_target = \"101000\".\n  - Run simulated annealing and report best configuration, energy, probability, and amplitude.\n\nOutput formatting:\n- Print a small header.\n- Print:\n  - Target bitstring\n  - Amplitude (real and imag with 6 decimals)\n  - Probability (6 decimals)\n  - Best bitstring found\n  - Best energy (6 decimals)\n  - Best probability (6 decimals)\n  - Best amplitude (real and imag with 6 decimals)\n\n- Ensure the script can be executed directly: if __name__ == \"__main__\": main()\n",
