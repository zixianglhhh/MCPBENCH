The architecture emphasizes performance (Core Web Vitals), accessibility, internationalization, and observability. Core components and interactions:\n\n- Client (Web/PWA): Next.js-rendered pages (SSR/SSG/ISR) for fast TTFB and SEO; client-side hydration for interactivity.\n- CDN + WAF: Global CDN for assets and pages; WAF and rate limiting to mitigate common web attacks.\n- Load Balancer + API Gateway: Routes traffic to backend services; enforces auth, request validation, throttling; supports blue/green or canary deployments.\n- Backend Service Layer (modular monolith to start; evolve to microservices as needed):\n  - Auth Service: OIDC/OAuth2.1; session and token management; RBAC/ABAC.\n  - User Profile Service: profile data, preferences, addresses.\n  - Content Service (Headless CMS): pages, posts, categories/tags, media assets, revisions, publishing workflows.\n  - E-commerce Service (optional): product catalog, variants, pricing, inventory, cart/checkout, orders, payments, refunds.\n  - Media Service: upload, optimize (WebP/AVIF), thumbnails, video transcoding via serverless.\n  - Search Service: full-text search, autocomplete; syncs from primary DB via change data capture.\n  - Notification Service: email, SMS, push; templates and localization.\n  - Admin Portal: role-gated back office for content, catalog, and user management.\n- Data Layer:\n  - Primary DB: PostgreSQL (normalized with JSONB for flexible fields); read replicas for scale.\n  - Cache: Redis for sessions, rate limits, hot queries, queues.\n  - Object Storage: S3-compatible for media and static exports; lifecycle and versioning.\n  - Search Index: OpenSearch/Elasticsearch for content and product search.\n  - Queue/Events: SNS/SQS or equivalent for async workflows (email, indexing, media processing).\n- Observability & Ops: Centralized logging, metrics, traces; dashboards and alerts; feature flags; secrets management; audit logging.\n- Security: HTTPS everywhere, HSTS, CSP, CSRF protection, input validation, encryption at rest/in transit, key rotation, least privilege IAM, periodic pen tests.\n- Environments: Dev, Staging, Prod with isolated resources; IaC for parity; seeded test data.\n\nDatabase design (relational core with illustrative tables and relationships):\n- Identity & Access:\n  - users(id, email, email_verified, password_hash, status, created_at)\n  - user_profiles(user_id FK users, display_name, avatar_url, locale, timezone, phone)\n  - roles(id, name), user_roles(user_id FK users, role_id FK roles)\n  - sessions(id, user_id, created_at, expires_at, ip_hash, user_agent)\n  - oauth_accounts(id, user_id, provider, provider_user_id, access_token_hash, refresh_token_hash)\n  - permissions(id, name), role_permissions(role_id FK roles, permission_id FK permissions)\n- Content (CMS):\n  - pages(id, slug UNIQUE, title, status, published_at, author_id FK users)\n  - posts(id, slug UNIQUE, title, excerpt, body_rich JSONB, status, published_at, author_id)\n  - categories(id, name, slug), tags(id, name, slug)\n  - post_categories(post_id FK posts, category_id FK categories)\n  - post_tags(post_id FK posts, tag_id FK tags)\n  - media_assets(id, url, type, width, height, duration, checksum, uploaded_by FK users)\n  - revisions(id, entity_type, entity_id, diff JSONB, editor_id, created_at)\n- E-commerce (optional module):\n  - products(id, slug, title, description, status)\n  - product_variants(id, product_id, sku UNIQUE, attributes JSONB, price_cents, currency)\n  - inventory(variant_id, quantity, reserved)\n  - prices(variant_id, price_cents, currency, effective_from, effective_to)\n  - carts(id, user_id NULLABLE, anonymous_id, created_at)\n  - cart_items(id, cart_id, variant_id, quantity)\n  - orders(id, user_id, status, subtotal_cents, tax_cents, shipping_cents, total_cents, currency, placed_at)\n  - order_items(id, order_id, variant_id, unit_price_cents, quantity)\n  - payments(id, order_id, provider, status, amount_cents, currency, transaction_ref, captured_at)\n  - refunds(id, payment_id, amount_cents, reason, processed_at)\n  - addresses(id, user_id, type, line1, line2, city, region, postal_code, country, is_default)\n  - shipments(id, order_id, carrier, tracking_number, status, shipped_at, delivered_at)\n- Engagement & Ops:\n  - notifications(id, user_id, channel, template_key, payload JSONB, status, sent_at)\n  - webhooks(id, target_url, event, secret_hash, active), webhook_deliveries(id, webhook_id, status, response_code, attempts)\n  - audit_logs(id, actor_user_id, action, entity_type, entity_id, metadata JSONB, created_at)\n  - consents(user_id, purpose, granted BOOLEAN, updated_at)\n\nIndexes & data practices:\n- Unique indexes on slugs, emails, SKUs; composite indexes for search (published_at DESC, status, category/tag join tables).\n- Partial indexes for active records; GIN indexes on JSONB and full-text tsvector columns.\n- Referential integrity with FK constraints and ON DELETE policies; soft-delete via status + deleted_at where needed.\n- Row-level security for multi-tenant setups (if applicable).\n- Data retention policies and archival tables for large audit/log datasets.\n\nKey service interactions:\n- CMS events trigger search reindexing via queue.\n- Order placement creates payment intent; on success, inventory is decremented atomically (transaction + outbox pattern to events).\n- Media uploads trigger serverless optimization and store derivatives; URLs cached at CDN.\n\nNon-functional requirements:\n- Performance budgets (TTFB < 200ms cached, LCP < 2.5s on 4G, CLS < 0.1, INP < 200ms).\n- Availability target 99.9% initially; RPO ≤ 15 min, RTO ≤ 1 hr with cross-AZ redundancy.\n- Compliance: GDPR/CCPA-ready (consents, data export/delete), PCI SAQ-A if payments handled via hosted fields/redirect.\n",

The script must be saved as 'main.py' and meet the following requirements.\n\nProgram goals:\n- Provide an automated pipeline that can:\n  1) Read and profile a potentially large CSV dataset.\n  2) Infer data types and clean data (missing values, zero-variance features, high missingness, etc.).\n  3) In AUTO mode, infer whether the task is classification, regression, clustering, or anomaly detection and choose a suitable target if present. If a target is provided or inferred, train and evaluate supervised models; otherwise, run unsupervised analysis.\n  4) Save a comprehensive report, artifacts (preprocessor/model/pipeline), predictions or labels, and diagnostic plots into an outputs directory.\n  5) Log all steps to a log file and handle errors gracefully.\n\nCommand-line interface (use argparse):\n- --file: Path to CSV file (default: 'complex.csv').\n- --task: One of ['auto', 'classification', 'regression', 'clustering', 'anomaly'] (default: 'auto').\n- --target: Optional target column name for supervised tasks. If omitted in 'auto', the program should try to infer a target.\n- --id-cols: Optional comma-separated list of ID-like columns to exclude from modeling.\n- --sample-rows: Optional integer to downsample the dataset for EDA/modeling if memory is constrained.\n- --test-size: Float test split proportion (default: 0.2).\n- --random-state: Integer seed (default: 42).\n- --output-dir: Output directory (default: 'code/complex_dataset_analysis/outputs').\n\nKey features and steps:\n1) Data loading:\n   - Use pandas.read_csv with low_memory=False and robust options.\n   - If --sample-rows is provided, read a random sample of that many rows (without loading the entire file if feasible); otherwise, load fully.\n   - Print/log basic info: shape, memory usage, column names.\n   - Normalize column names to snake_case and strip whitespace.\n\n2) Type inference:\n   - Infer column types into: numeric, categorical, datetime, and text.\n   - Heuristics:\n     - Numeric: pandas numeric dtypes.\n     - Datetime: try to parse with pandas.to_datetime on object columns with high parse success.\n     - Text: object columns whose average token count > 3.\n     - Categorical: remaining object/bool columns.\n   - Summarize counts per type and example columns.\n\n3) Cleaning and preprocessing:\n   - Drop columns with >95% missingness and zero-variance columns; log these decisions.\n   - Imputation:\n     - Numeric: SimpleImputer(strategy='median').\n     - Categorical: SimpleImputer(strategy='most_frequent').\n     - Text: SimpleImputer(fill_value='').\n   - Preprocessing pipeline via ColumnTransformer:\n     - Numeric: impute + RobustScaler().\n     - Categorical: impute + OneHotEncoder(handle_unknown='ignore', sparse_output=False) [if sklearn version requires, use sparse=False].\n     - Text: TfidfVectorizer(stop_words='english', max_features=5000). For multiple text columns, vectorize each then combine via ColumnTransformer.\n   - Warn and optionally drop extremely high-cardinality categoricals (e.g., > 1000 unique values) to reduce memory; log any drops.\n\n4) Exploratory analysis and plots (save to output_dir/figures):\n   - Save basic stats (describe) to a file.\n   - Plot distributions for up to top 20 numeric columns.\n   - Correlation heatmap for numeric features (handle large feature counts by capping at, say, 50 columns via variance or random selection).\n   - If target exists: plot target distribution (classification) or histogram (regression), and target-vs-top-features plots where feasible.\n   - Catch and log plotting errors so the script continues.\n\n5) AUTO task inference:\n   - If --task is 'auto':\n     - Try to find a target column using common names: ['target','label','y','outcome','class'] (case-insensitive).\n     - If none, look for columns with low unique ratio (< 0.2) and not ID-like (name matching r'^(id|uuid|guid)$' or unique count ~ nrows). Prefer binary or low-cardinality for classification; if a numeric column with many distinct values is plausible, consider regression.\n     - If no decent candidate target is found, default to unsupervised path (run both clustering and anomaly detection and report both).\n\n6) Modeling and evaluation:\n   - Train/test split by --test-size and --random-state. Use StratifiedKFold where appropriate for cross-validation.\n   - Build sklearn Pipelines that combine the ColumnTransformer preprocessor with the estimator.\n   - Classification models: LogisticRegression(max_iter=2000, n_jobs=None as applicable), RandomForestClassifier, GradientBoostingClassifier. Choose best via cross-validated balanced accuracy or ROC-AUC (if binary). Provide confusion matrix, classification report, ROC-AUC if binary.\n   - Regression models: LinearRegression, RandomForestRegressor, GradientBoostingRegressor. Choose best by cross-validated R2 (primary) and report MAE and RMSE on test.\n   - Unsupervised:\n     - Clustering: run KMeans for k in 2..8, compute silhouette score on transformed features, choose best k, save cluster labels and sizes, and silhouette score. Save clusters.csv with id/index and cluster label.\n     - Anomaly detection: IsolationForest(random_state), and LocalOutlierFactor (novelty=False for scoring). Save anomalies.csv with score and a boolean flag. Include top-N anomalies (e.g., top 1% by score magnitude) in report.\n\n7) Outputs to save (under output_dir):\n   - report.md: human-readable summary of dataset, preprocessing, task selection rationale, metrics, and recommendations.\n   - figures/: all plots.\n   - artifacts/: preprocessor.joblib, model.joblib, full pipeline pipeline.joblib (for supervised tasks), plus selected k for clustering and any fitted unsupervised objects as applicable.\n   - predictions.csv (for supervised tasks) with index/ID and predicted values; include probabilities for classification if feasible.\n   - clusters.csv and/or anomalies.csv for unsupervised tasks.\n   - run.log: log file with INFO level and timestamps.\n\n8) Robustness and structure:\n   - Organize code into functions: load_data, normalize_columns, infer_types, build_preprocessor, select_task_and_target, build_supervised_models, evaluate_classification, evaluate_regression, run_clustering, run_anomaly_detection, generate_plots, save_report, ensure_output_dirs, main.\n   - Use try/except blocks around major steps to continue even if some operations fail; write errors to log and to the report.\n   - Use a global random seed (--random-state) for reproducibility.\n   - Print a concise summary to stdout at the end: detected task, key metrics, and paths of saved outputs.\n\n9) Dependencies:\n   - Use only: pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, scipy, matplotlib, seaborn, joblib, and standard library (argparse, logging, os, re, json, pathlib, warnings, typing, textwrap).\n   - Include at the top of the script a brief usage docstring with example commands, e.g.:\n     - python code/complex_dataset_analysis/main.py --file complex.csv --task auto\n     - python code/complex_dataset_analysis/main.py --file complex.csv --task classification --target target_column\n\nImplementation notes:\n- Ensure directories exist before writing (output_dir, figures, artifacts).\n- When sampling rows, if the dataset is huge, use an iterator approach (read in chunks and sample) or fall back to reading nrows if necessary; document the approach in logs.\n- Guard against memory blow-ups when one-hot encoding by capping number of categories (e.g., drop/aggregate columns with >1000 unique categories) and log any such decisions.\n- Ensure code is importable and has `if __name__ == \"__main__\": main()`.\n- Handle both Windows and Unix paths via pathlib.\n\nDeliver a single, clean, well-structured Python file that fulfills all the above and runs end-to-end.",

Try to fetch CSV from\n       https://data.giss.nasa.gov/gistemp/tabledata_v4/GLB.Ts+dSST.csv\n     Parsing guidance: The file contains a header row beginning with \"Year\", monthly columns Jan..Dec, and aggregate columns (J-D, D-N, DJF, MAM, JJA, SON). Some rows or footers may be present; keep only lines that begin with a digit. Coerce non-numeric cells to NaN. Build a long-format monthly time series with a proper datetime index (YYYY-MM-01).\n   - Fallback: Berkeley Earth Global Land + Ocean monthly file\n       http://berkeleyearth.lbl.gov/auto/Global/Complete_TAVG_complete.txt\n     Parsing guidance: Lines beginning with '%' are comments. Columns are whitespace-separated; use first four columns as Year, Month, MonthlyAnomaly_C, MonthlyUnc_C. Build a datetime index (YYYY-MM-01) and use the monthly anomaly series (°C relative to the Berkeley Earth baseline).\n   - If both sources fail, emit a clear message in the report and exit gracefully.\n\n2) Data preparation:\n   - Create a pandas Series of monthly global temperature anomalies (in °C) with a DateTimeIndex at monthly frequency.\n   - Determine the last fully available month; define the last-decade window as the 120 months up to that last month (or all available if less than 120 months).\n   - Also compute annual means (calendar year) for reporting and trend estimation.\n\n3) Trend estimation (last decade):\n   - Compute the linear trend (°C/decade) using OLS with robust (HC3) standard errors on annual-mean data for the last decade window. Provide slope and 95% confidence interval.\n   - As a secondary check, compute the Theil–Sen slope on monthly data (if scipy available; otherwise skip gracefully) and include it in the report.\n\n4) Forecasting model:\n   - Prefer SARIMAX from statsmodels: fit to the monthly anomaly series over the full available period using order=(1,1,1), seasonal_order=(0,1,1,12), enforce_stationarity=False, enforce_invertibility=False. If the fit fails, try a simpler ARIMA(1,1,0) without seasonality. If statsmodels is unavailable, fall back to ordinary least squares (numpy.polyfit) on monthly data to generate a trend-only forecast.\n   - Forecast the next 120 months (10 years). Provide 95% confidence intervals. For the OLS fallback, estimate residual std from in-sample residuals and build symmetric CIs.\n\n5) Outputs (must be created in the current working directory):\n   - climate_forecast.csv: columns [date, mean, lower_95, upper_95].\n   - climate_trend_report.txt: a readable text report including:\n       * Data source used and last available observation date.\n       * Last decade linear trend (°C/decade) with 95% CI and method.\n       * Secondary Theil–Sen slope if available.\n       * Forecast highlights: mean predicted anomalies (and 95% CI) for 2030, 2035, 2040 (annual means).\n       * Brief methodology description, assumptions, and limitations.\n       * References/links to the data sources actually used (NASA GISTEMP v4 and/or Berkeley Earth).\n   - climate_forecast_plot.png: a plot with historical monthly anomalies, annual means, and the 10-year forecast with 95% CI shaded; include labels, legend, source note, and baseline note.\n   - Print to stdout a concise summary with: data source, last decade trend, and the next-10-year average anomaly with CI.\n\n6) Implementation details and robustness:\n   - Use only standard scientific Python stack: requests, io, pandas, numpy, matplotlib, statsmodels (optional), scipy (optional). Wrap imports and steps in try/except with clear messages; continue with fallbacks.\n   - Ensure the script runs end-to-end without raising uncaught exceptions; on major failure, write a minimal report explaining the failure.\n   - Use UTC-naive timestamps and set pandas options to avoid chained assignment warnings.\n\nDeliver the full script content that meets the above and save it to the provided output path.",

Target: 100 players (solo/duo/squad), match length 20–25 minutes, PC/console. Objectives: leverage the mixed environments to drive varied combat (long-range in open fields, mid/close-quarters in urban), ensure fair loot and spawn distribution, compelling rotations, and strong pacing through a dynamically shrinking safe zone. Constraints: maintain 60+ FPS on mid-tier hardware; robust online play with dedicated servers and anti-cheat; good onboarding and bots to backfill; fast matchmaking. Core systems to design: (1) environment utilization and player flow, (2) loot tiering and distribution, (3) drop/landing and early game hotspots, (4) safe zone (circle/storm) phases (5–8 phases) and randomness, (5) combat roles and TTK (0.5–0.9s), (6) health/armor/knockdown-revive, (7) weapons/attachments/throwables, (8) vehicles and traversal, (9) events (airdrops, high-value zones), (10) anti-camping incentives, (11) sound/visibility, (12) economy/progression, (13) technical optimization (world partition, HLOD, Nanite/Lumen settings, replication budgets), (14) netcode model and anti-cheat. Environments to combine: open fields for sightlines and vehicle lanes; small urban blocks for POIs and vertical fights; plus variants created via set dressing (trees, rocks, fences, warehouses, bridges, radio tower hill, docks). Deliver: a strategic analysis with actionable recommendations for map composition, spawn/loot heatmaps, zone behavior, pacing milestones, system balance, engagement loops, and UE5-specific optimization tips."

Use the Close column.\n- Modeling:\n  - Primary model: ARIMA using statsmodels (order=(5,1,0) as a simple baseline). If model fitting fails (e.g., too few points or library missing), gracefully fall back to a naive drift forecast.\n  - Forecast horizon: 5 business days ahead.\n- Outputs (save in the same folder as this script):\n  - prediction.csv with columns: date,actual_close,predicted_close. Historical rows should have actual_close filled and predicted_close empty; forecast rows should have predicted_close filled and actual_close empty.\n  - prediction.jpg: Line chart showing historical actual_close and predicted_close, clearly labeled with legend, title, and axes. Save at 200 DPI.\n- Robustness:\n  - Create the target directory if needed.\n  - Handle missing data or short history gracefully.\n  - Do not crash if statsmodels isn’t installed; implement a fallback forecast.\n  - Print concise status messages so users can see progress.\n\nBelow is the complete script to save exactly as finance/Alphabet/predict_stock.py:\n\n\"\"\"\nPredict short-term GOOGL closing prices from last month of data and save results.\nOutputs:\n  - finance/Alphabet/prediction.csv\n  - finance/Alphabet/prediction.jpg\n\"\"\"\nimport os\nfrom pathlib import Path\nimport sys\nimport warnings\nwarnings.filterwarnings(\"ignore\")\n\n# Ensure third-party imports are handled with clear guidance\ntry:\n    import pandas as pd\n    import numpy as np\nexcept Exception as e:\n    print(\"ERROR: pandas/numpy not available.

Keep the code concise and under ~1500 tokens while still being practical.\n\nFunctional requirements:\n- No external network calls. Use only local data.\n- Use scikit-learn with a Pipeline consisting of:\n  - Text cleaning/normalization step (lowercase, strip, collapse whitespace; replace URLs with <URL>, numbers with <NUM>, currency symbols with <CUR>). Minimal regex-based cleaning is fine.\n  - TF-IDF vectorizer with reasonable defaults (e.g., word 1-2 grams, sublinear_tf=True, max_df ~0.9, min_df ~2).\n  - LogisticRegression classifier with class_weight=\"balanced\" to handle class imbalance. Use a solver that works for sparse data (e.g., liblinear or saga). Expose random_state for reproducibility.\n- Provide probability scores with predict_proba and label messages as 'junk' if the scam/spam probability >= threshold.\n- Include a simple threshold optimization on a validation split (e.g., scan thresholds 0.1..0.9 to maximize F1 for the positive class). Default threshold=0.5 if optimization is disabled or fails. Save the chosen threshold with the model.\n\nProgram structure:\n- Implement a class ScamSMSFilter with methods:\n  - fit(train_texts: List[str], train_labels: List[int or str]) -> self\n  - predict_proba(texts: List[str]) -> np.ndarray (prob for negative/positive)\n  - predict(texts: List[str], threshold: Optional[float] = None) -> List[str] returning labels [\"ham\"|\"junk\"]\n  - save(model_path: str) -> None (saves pipeline, threshold, and metadata with joblib)\n  - load(model_path: str) -> \"ScamSMSFilter\" (class method)\n- Provide evaluation metrics (precision, recall, f1 for each class; confusion matrix) on a held-out validation set during training and print them nicely.\n- Include a lightweight keyword heuristic that contributes an optional feature: if certain suspicious tokens (e.g., \"win\", \"prize\", \"urgent\", \"claim\", \"free\", \"limited\", \"offer\", \"click\", \"verify\", \"password\", currency symbols, phone numbers) are present, add a binary feature column. Implement via a ColumnTransformer that combines TF-IDF and this binary feature. Keep it compact.\n\nCLI requirements (argparse):\n- Subcommands:\n  - train: --data PATH points to a CSV. Options: --text-col TEXT_COLUMN (default: \"text\"), --label-col LABEL_COLUMN (default: \"label\"), --model-out MODEL_PATH (default: scam_sms_model.joblib), --test-size (default: 0.2), --no-threshold-tune to skip tuning.\n  - predict: --model MODEL_PATH, and one of: --text \"...\" (can be repeated), --file PATH (text file with one message per line), or --csv PATH with --text-col TEXT_COLUMN. Optional --threshold FLOAT to override saved threshold. Output each prediction as JSON lines with fields: text, prob_junk, label.\n- Labels: accept label values {\"ham\",\"spam\"} or {0,1}; treat positive class as spam/scam/junk.\n- Include main guard with examples in the module docstring.\n\nImplementation details:\n- Minimal dependencies: scikit-learn, pandas, numpy, joblib. Do not rely on GPUs.\n- Ensure reproducibility: set random_state=42 where applicable.\n- Be careful with TfidfVectorizer preprocessing. Use a FunctionTransformer for cleaning, then pass cleaned text to TF-IDF. Alternatively, implement a small transformer class for cleaning. Keep it simple.\n- Ensure robust I/O: if a CSV has extra columns, only use specified ones. Strip NaNs. For predict, ignore blank lines.\n- Keep code clear with docstrings and usage examples.\n- Do not include any placeholder content; provide working, runnable code.\n",

If omitted, no throttling is applied.\n   - --policy, -p: choices={auto, throttle, affinity, priority, all}. Default auto.\n       * auto: if --cpu-cap provided, apply throttle (+ optional affinity auto-derivation). Otherwise adjust priority only.\n       * throttle: only enforce CPU cap via suspend/resume duty-cycle.\n       * affinity: only set CPU affinity (if supported) and do nothing else.\n       * priority: only set process priority/niceness.\n       * all: apply priority, affinity (if provided/auto), then throttle if --cpu-cap is set.\n   - --priority, -r: choices={low, normal, high}. Default normal. Maps to OS-specific classes.\n   - --affinity, -a: comma-separated list of 0-based CPU indices (e.g., \"0,1,3\"). If set to \"auto\" and --cpu-cap is provided, compute the minimal integer core count n = max(1, ceil(cpu_cap/100)) and bind to the first n CPUs.\n   - --include-children: if set, apply suspend/resume to child processes recursively and set affinity/priority for them as well when possible.\n   - --interval, -i: sampling/throttling interval in seconds (float), default 0.25, min 0.05, max 2.0.\n   - --grace, -g: warmup seconds before first throttling action (default 0.5).\n   - --verbose, -v: increase logging verbosity; can be specified multiple times for more detail.\n\n2) Launch the target program using subprocess.Popen. Capture the child PID and maintain a psutil.Process handle. The wrapper should:\n   - Optionally set priority/niceness according to --priority on all OSes:\n       * Windows: use psutil \"HIGH_PRIORITY_CLASS\"/\"BELOW_NORMAL_PRIORITY_CLASS\"/\"NORMAL_PRIORITY_CLASS\".\n       * Linux/macOS: use psutil.Process.nice() with lower value for high priority (e.g., -5), higher value for low priority (e.g., +10), and 0 for normal; ignore errors if not permitted.\n   - Optionally set CPU affinity using psutil.Process.cpu_affinity() where supported (Linux, Windows). On macOS, warn that affinity is not supported and continue.\n\n3) Throttling controller (when --cpu-cap provided and policy permits throttle):\n   - Use a duty-cycle approach based on suspend/resume (psutil.Process.suspend()/resume()).\n   - Maintain a moving average of process CPU percent to stabilize control (exponential moving average with alpha ~ 0.3).\n   - Each control step:\n       * Sleep for the configured interval to gather CPU measurement resolution.\n       * Poll process CPU percent via process.cpu_percent(None). Handle NoSuchProcess gracefully.\n       * If EMA <= cap + small hysteresis (e.g., 1.5%), keep process resumed.\n       * Else, compute a duty fraction d = min(1.0, max(0.0, cap / max(EMA, 1e-6))). Convert to run_time = interval * d and sleep_time = interval - run_time.\n       * Implement: ensure min_run and min_sleep of at least 0.02s to avoid thrashing; if sleep_time <= 0, just keep running.\n       * Perform: ensure process is resumed for run_time, then suspended for sleep_time. If include-children, propagate suspend/resume to children recursively.\n   - Use time.monotonic for timing. Handle cases where suspend/resume fails (e.g., access denied) by logging a warning and disabling throttling.\n\n4) Child process management:\n   - Forward signals: on KeyboardInterrupt or SIGTERM to the wrapper, terminate the child gracefully (send terminate, then kill on timeout). Propagate exit code.\n   - If the child exits on its own, stop the control loop and exit with the child's return code.\n\n5) Logging:\n   - Use the logging module. Support verbosity levels (-v, -vv). Log the applied settings (policy, cap, priority, affinity) at startup. During throttling, optionally log periodic status lines with measured CPU%, EMA, duty, and current state (running/suspended) when verbose.\n\n6) Cross-platform considerations and fallbacks:\n   - If psutil is missing: print an error to stderr with installation hint and exit 2.\n   - On macOS, affinity is not supported: detect and warn once. Throttling and priority should still work.\n   - Permission errors when changing priority or suspending should be caught and logged as warnings without aborting; continue with what is possible.\n\n7) Code structure:\n   - main() parses args and orchestrates.\n   - Helper functions: set_priority(proc, level), set_affinity(proc, mask), get_all_related_procs(proc, recursive), safe_suspend(list_of_procs), safe_resume(list_of_procs), and throttle_loop(proc, ...).\n   - Exit with the child's exit code (or 2 on usage/psutil error).\n\n8) Documentation:\n   - Add a top-of-file docstring describing purpose, installation (pip install psutil), and usage examples:\n       Examples:\n       - python cpu_optimizer.py --cpu-cap 35 --priority low -- echo \"busy task\"\n       - python cpu_optimizer.py -c 50 -p all -a auto --interval 0.2 -- python myscript.py --arg1 42\n       - python cpu_optimizer.py -p priority -r high -- ./heavy_binary --opt\n\nPlease include robust argument parsing that supports using \"--\" to pass the target command unmodified, thorough error handling, and clear logs. Keep external dependencies to just psutil. Use only the standard library plus psutil.\n",

Read that file as context and produce a drop-in, API-compatible, highly optimized version named new_heavy_numeric_computations.py with the following requirements:\n\nGeneral goals:\n- Preserve the public API (function names, signatures, return types, and side effects) unless a clear bug fix requires minimal change. Maintain numerical correctness and determinism where applicable.\n- Replace Python-level loops with NumPy vectorized operations and broadcasting wherever feasible.\n- Prefer NumPy ufuncs, einsum, matmul, and BLAS/LAPACK-backed routines (numpy/scipy) over manual loops.\n- Minimize temporary allocations and enable in-place operations when safe (e.g., out=, where=, and in-place operators) to reduce memory pressure.\n- Where vectorization isn’t possible, use Numba JIT (@njit) with parallel=True and prange for CPU-bound loops. Add fastmath=True only if it does not compromise correctness (document any trade-offs).\n- For embarrassingly parallel workloads across independent chunks, add Joblib (or multiprocessing) based parallelization with configurable n_jobs and chunk size.\n- Provide a memory-aware chunking strategy for very large arrays, keeping peak memory usage bounded. Use views instead of copies when possible.\n- Add dtype controls (e.g., allow float32 option) when it is safe, but default to original precision to preserve results.\n- Ensure thread-safety and no unintended global state changes. Do not reduce numerical stability.\n- Add concise docstrings and type hints. Keep imports minimal and standard. Optional dependencies (numba, joblib) should be gracefully handled.\n\nSpecific implementation guidance (adapt as appropriate to the original content):\n- If there are nested loops doing element-wise combinations, replace them with vectorized broadcasting, fromiter patterns, or ufunc.outer/einsum.\n- If there are rolling/accumulation steps, use numpy.cumsum, numpy.cumprod, numpy.add.at, or grouped reductions.\n- For distance/similarity computations, use scipy.spatial.distance.cdist or optimized einsum patterns.\n- For polynomial or basis transforms, use numpy.polynomial or vectorized Horner’s method; avoid Python loops.\n- For Monte Carlo or random sampling, use numpy.random.Generator with vectorized draws and avoid per-sample Python calls.\n- If linear algebra is involved, rely on numpy.linalg/scipy.linalg (batched where possible) rather than manual elimination.\n- If convolution/correlation appears, use scipy.signal (or FFT-based methods via numpy.fft) when sizes warrant.\n- Ensure that broadcasting rules are used to eliminate expand_dims/tiling unless strictly necessary.\n\nParallelization:\n- Provide an optional parameter (e.g., n_jobs: int | None) for relevant top-level functions to control parallelism. If n_jobs is None or 1, run single-threaded vectorized path. If >1, use joblib.Parallel(backend='loky') and delayed over chunks or Numba parallel loops where appropriate.\n- Use a helper to split large arrays into balanced chunks. Prefer contiguous slicing and avoid re-chunking intermediate buffers.\n- Document that BLAS may already use multithreading; recommend setting environment variables (e.g., OMP_NUM_THREADS) externally to avoid oversubscription.\n\nNumerical fidelity and tests:\n- Keep results identical (within floating point tolerance) to the original implementation. Where approximations are introduced, guard with a flag exact=True by default.\n- Add lightweight self-checks: a few assert-like sanity checks in __main__ to compare original vs. optimized for small random inputs (if original functions can be imported or kept under a guarded block). If not possible, add a simple benchmark harness showing usage.\n\nAPI and structure:\n- Maintain the same module-level functions and class methods; internally refactor to helpers: _vectorized_xxx, _numba_xxx, _parallel_xxx.\n- Provide clear docstrings for each public API function: parameters, shapes/dtypes, returns, and performance notes.\n- Include type hints throughout.\n- Avoid excessive logging; include optional verbose flag for timing.\n\nGraceful fallbacks:\n- Wrap Numba imports in try/except; if unavailable, keep a pure-NumPy vectorized path. Same for joblib. Add informative warnings only when verbose=True.\n\nAt the end of the file:\n- Include a __main__ block that: (a) constructs representative random inputs, (b) runs the main heavy functions in both single-threaded and parallel modes (if available), (c) prints timing comparisons and basic correctness checks (max abs diff, relative error).\n\nDeliver only the optimized code content, not explanations, and ensure it is self-contained and runnable when placed at code/new_heavy_numeric_computations.py.",

Requirements:\n\n1) State and amplitude definitions\n- Consider an n-qubit product state: |ψ(θ, φ)⟩ = ⊗_i (cos θ_i |0⟩ + e^{i φ_i} sin θ_i |1⟩)\n- For a target bitstring b ∈ {0,1}^n, define the complex amplitude A(b; θ, φ) = ∏_i [cos θ_i if b_i=0 else e^{i φ_i} sin θ_i].\n- Probability P(b; θ) = |A(b; θ, φ)|^2 = ∏_i [cos^2 θ_i if b_i=0 else sin^2 θ_i] (independent of φ).\n\n2) Specific constraints (deterministic example)\n- Use n=4, target bitstring b = \"1010\" (indexing i=0..3)\n- Fix the angles exactly as:\n  θ0 = π/6\n  θ1 = π/3\n  θ2 = π/4\n  θ3 = π/8\n- Set all φ_i = 0 (phase does not affect probability but simplifies amplitude to be real and nonnegative).\n- These constraints make the feasible set a single point; therefore the maximum probability is the value at this point. The simulated annealing should still be implemented to verify this maximum.\n\n3) Simulated annealing (SA)\n- Implement a generic SA loop for continuous variables in [0, π/2], but enforce the above fixed-angle constraints by projecting back to the fixed values each iteration (so the state stays feasible). Even though there are no free variables under these constraints, keep the SA machinery in place to demonstrate the method and to make the script easily extensible.\n- Use a temperature schedule T_k = T0 * α^k with T0 = 1.0, α = 0.95, min temperature T_min = 1e-4, and iterations_per_temp = 100. Use a small Gaussian perturbation proposal scaled by temperature.\n- Objective for SA: maximize log P(b; θ) = Σ_i log(cos^2 θ_i) if b_i=0 else log(sin^2 θ_i), using a small epsilon to avoid log(0).\n- Acceptance rule: accept if Δ ≥ 0; else accept with probability exp(Δ/T). Enforce constraints strictly by projecting θ back to their fixed values each step. As a result, the best state found should equal the fixed angles.\n\n4) Output\n- Compute and print:\n  - The amplitude A for b (as a Python complex number with φ=0)\n  - The probability P = |A|^2\n  - The angles θ in radians\n  - The final maximum probability found by SA (should match P)\n- Use deterministic seeding (e.g., random.seed(42)).\n- Print values with clear labels and a reasonable precision (e.g., 12 decimal places for probability).\n\n5) Implementation details\n- Use only Python standard library (math, cmath, random, typing).\n- Organize code with functions:\n  amplitude(theta, phi, bits) -> complex\n  probability(theta, bits) -> float\n  log_probability(theta, bits, eps=1e-15) -> float\n  project_to_constraints(theta) -> list[float]  # applies the fixed-angle constraints\n  simulated_annealing(theta_init, bits) -> dict with keys {\"best_theta\", \"best_prob\", \"best_amp\"}\n- In __main__, set up the problem with the constraints above, run the calculations, and print the results.\n\n6) Expected numerical values to cross-check internally (not hard-coded):\n- Target bits b = 1010\n- θ = [π/6, π/3, π/4, π/8]\n- With φ = [0, 0, 0, 0], the amplitude magnitude should be (1/2)*(1/2)*(√2/2)*cos(π/8) and the probability should be ((2 + √2)/128) ≈ 0.026673543456.\n\nProvide clean, well-documented code that runs as a script and prints the results when executed.",
