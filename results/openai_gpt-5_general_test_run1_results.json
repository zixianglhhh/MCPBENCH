Start with a modular monolith to reduce complexity; carve out search/media later if needed.\n\nArchitecture (layered):\n- Client/Presentation: Responsive web app served via CDN; SSR/SSG for speed and SEO; PWA enhancements for offline caching of key pages.\n- Edge & Security: CDN (with caching, image optimization), WAF, TLS, rate limiting, bot protection.\n- Application Layer: Next.js for SSR/SSG, server components for performance. Admin CMS UI separated behind auth.\n- API Layer: Backend service (NestJS) exposing REST (for broad compatibility) and GraphQL (for CMS/admin and rich queries). API gateway handles routing, throttling, and auth.\n- Core Services:\n  - Auth & Identity: OAuth2/OIDC (Auth0/Keycloak). Users, roles, permissions. Session management and CSRF protection.\n  - Content Service: Headless CMS (Strapi) or custom content module for pages, posts, categories, media attachments, and scheduling.\n  - Media Service: Image/video upload, processing, CDN delivery; supports responsive images and WebP/AVIF.\n  - Search Service: Elasticsearch/OpenSearch for site-wide search with facets and synonyms.\n  - Notification Service: Email (transactional and marketing with double opt-in), webhook integrations.\n  - Optional Commerce: Product catalog, cart, orders, payments via Stripe.\n- Data Layer:\n  - Primary relational DB (PostgreSQL) for users, content, leads, orders.\n  - Cache (Redis) for sessions, rate limits, hot content, and queues.\n  - Search index (Elasticsearch) for full-text and faceted search.\n  - Object storage (S3-compatible) for media assets; versioning enabled.\n- Observability: Centralized logging (ELK or OpenSearch), metrics (Prometheus/Grafana), tracing (OpenTelemetry), error tracking (Sentry).\n- CI/CD & IaC: GitHub Actions for pipelines, Docker containers, Terraform for infra; blue/green or canary deployments.\n\nData Flow (example):\n- Visitor requests page -> CDN cache hit; on miss, Next.js SSR -> fetch content via API -> cache in Redis -> render -> return with CDN caching and ETags.\n- Search -> frontend queries GraphQL/REST -> search service hits Elasticsearch -> return ranked results.\n- Admin publishes content -> CMS writes to Postgres -> triggers reindex to Elasticsearch and cache invalidation.\n\nSecurity & Compliance:\n- OWASP ASVS baseline, input validation/sanitization, strict CSP, secure cookies, HTTP-only, SameSite, CSRF tokens.\n- Role-based access; least privilege; audit logs; GDPR/CCPA data subject rights handling; DPA and consent management.\n\nScalability Strategy:\n- Vertical scale for DB; horizontal scale for stateless frontend/backend.\n- Introduce message queues for async tasks (email, media processing).\n- Split search/media into separate services if traffic grows; adopt autoscaling.\n",

Save variance explained plot and a 2D PCA scatter (color by target if available).\n\n5) Task Modes\n- 'profile': Only profiling + EDA + PCA plots, no modeling; write a markdown report summarizing findings.\n- 'auto': If target provided or detected, decide classification vs regression:\n  - Target detection heuristics: use provided --target; else look for column named 'target'/'label'; else choose last column if non-unique and not all distinct; else unsupervised fallback to 'cluster'.\n  - Classification if target is categorical (<=20 unique values or non-numeric), regression if numeric with sufficient unique values.\n- 'classify' and 'regress': require target or use heuristics; raise a clear error if no suitable target found.\n- 'cluster': perform KMeans (k selected by maximizing silhouette over k in [2..10]); also try DBSCAN with eps via kNN distance elbow; save labels and plots.\n\n6) Modeling Pipelines\n- Build sklearn Pipeline with preprocessing (ColumnTransformer) and model:\n  - Classification models: LogisticRegression, RandomForestClassifier, GradientBoostingClassifier; use GridSearchCV across sensible hyperparameters and CV=5; score by roc_auc (if binary) else f1_macro.\n  - Regression models: LinearRegression, RandomForestRegressor, GradientBoostingRegressor, Ridge; use GridSearchCV with CV=5; score by neg_root_mean_squared_error.\n- Train-test split using test_size.\n- Evaluate metrics:\n  - Classification: accuracy, precision, recall, f1_macro, ROC-AUC (binary), confusion matrix plot.\n  - Regression: R2, MAE, RMSE; residuals plot and predicted vs actual plot.\n- Feature importance:\n  - For tree-based models, save feature importances; for linear models, save coefficients.\n- Persist artifacts: best estimator pipeline and label encoder (if used) saved via joblib in outdir.\n\n7) Reporting\n- Write a concise markdown report to outdir/report.md including:\n  - Data overview (shape, columns, missingness)\n  - Preprocessing actions taken\n  - EDA highlights (top correlations, distribution insights)\n  - PCA summary (explained variance)\n  - Modeling summary: selected model, hyperparameters, metrics\n  - Clustering summary (if cluster mode): chosen k, silhouette score, cluster counts\n  - Paths to saved artifacts and plots\n\n8) Robustness & Structure\n- Organize code with clear functions: load_data, profile_data, preprocess_data, run_eda, run_pca, detect_task, build_models, evaluate_and_report, run_clustering, write_report, save_artifact_paths.\n- Add type hints and docstrings.\n- Use logging (INFO level) and a basic exception handling wrapper in main().\n- Ensure the script creates directories as needed.\n\n9) Dependencies\n- Use only: pandas, numpy, scipy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn, joblib.\n- If import fails, print a helpful message instructing pip install commands and exit.\n\n10) Execution\n- When run as a script, execute the pipeline according to CLI options.\n- Default behavior: python code/complex_dataset_analysis/complex_dataset_analysis.py --input complex.csv --task auto --outdir code/complex_dataset_analysis/output\n\nEnsure the file saves exactly to 'code/complex_dataset_analysis/complex_dataset_analysis.py'.

Data sources: NASA GISTEMP v4 global monthly temperature anomalies and NOAA Mauna Loa global atmospheric CO2. Constraints: Use only Python standard libraries (urllib, csv, json, math, datetime) to avoid dependency issues. Save outputs to text and JSON files. Steps: fetch, parse, align, model, forecast, and summarize.\n\nRequirements:\n- Fetch NASA GISTEMP v4 global monthly temperature anomalies (CSV): https://data.giss.nasa.gov/gistemp/tabledata_v4/GLB.Ts+dSST.csv\n- Fetch NOAA Mauna Loa monthly CO2 (CSV): https://gml.noaa.gov/webdata/ccgg/trends/co2/co2_mm_mlo.csv\n- Parse and extract the last 10 years of monthly data available from both sources.\n- Align the time series by year-month. If a value is missing, skip that month.\n- Build an OLS multivariate regression: TempAnomaly = a + b_time * t + c_co2 * CO2, where t is month index from the start of the 10-year window (0..N-1).\n- Implement small linear algebra utilities for 3x3 matrix inverse via adjugate to avoid external libs.\n- Compute a simple linear regression for CO2 over time to project CO2 for the next 10 years (monthly), then predict TempAnomaly using the multivariate model.\n- Output:\n  * forecast_summary.txt: key figures (warming rate per decade, model coefficients, R^2, projected anomalies by year for next decade, uncertainties caveat).\n  * forecast_results.json: structured output with coefficients, R^2, last-10-year stats, monthly forecasts for the next 10 years (year, month, predicted anomaly, projected CO2).\n- Include robust exception handling and an offline fallback: if downloads fail, use a minimal embedded sample representing recent trends (annotate as fallback-only) sufficient to run the pipeline.\n- Print to stdout a compact summary of results.\n\nPlease generate a single Python file with clear functions, inline comments, and a main guard.\n\nNotes:\n- Scientific caveats: This is a simple statistical model using time and CO2; it does not capture internal variability, aerosols, land-use changes, ENSO, or nonlinearities.

Keep the same feature set. Then predict and print using the same formatting and labels.\n\n5) Code quality:\n   - Organize into functions: build_dataset(), train_model(X, y), predict(day, year, model), pretty_print(prediction_dict).\n   - Ensure the script runs as a standalone program: if __name__ == \"__main__\": build dataset, train, predict 2025-03-15, and print.\n   - Use clear comments and docstrings.\n\nAt the end, the script should print something like:\n\"Prediction for London on 2025-03-15:\\n  Avg temp: 10.1°C\\n  Precip probability: 41%\\n  Conditions: mostly cloudy with a chance of light rain\\n(Note: Trained on a deterministic synthetic dataset approximating typical early-March conditions.)\"\n",

Title and legend included. Save to finance/Alphabet/prediction.jpg.\n8) Include basic error handling (e.g., if no data is returned).\n9) Print a summary of the last historical date and the predicted next 5 business days to stdout.\n\nImplementation details:\n- Use pandas, numpy, yfinance, scikit-learn (LinearRegression), matplotlib.\n- Generate next 5 business dates with pandas.bdate_range after the last historical date.\n- Train the model using lag features derived from the historical Close data (lags 1..5), dropping rows with NaNs.\n- For recursive prediction: use the latest available closing values to generate lag features for step 1, append the predicted value, and repeat for steps 2..5.\n- Ensure figures are saved with reasonable resolution (e.g., dpi=150).\n- Use if __name__ == \"__main__\": to run the pipeline.\n\nPlease include complete, runnable code that performs all tasks when executed.",

Labels: \"junk\" or \"legit\". If training_data is None, use built-in tiny dataset to bootstrap.\n   - predict(self, text: str, message_id: str | None = None) -> dict: returns {\"label\": \"junk\"|\"legit\", \"confidence\": float, \"risk_score\": float, \"ml_prob\": float | None, \"reasons\": list[str], \"message_id\": str | None}.\n   - batch_predict(self, messages: list[tuple[str, str]]) -> list[dict]: input is [(id, text)] and returns predictions; when label == \"junk\", automatically mark as junk.\n   - mark_as_junk(self, message_id: str | None, text: str) -> str: appends to junk/junk_messages.json (creates directory/file if missing) with fields {id, text, timestamp, reasons} and returns the file path.\n\n3) Heuristics: Implement helper functions to detect common scam signals and accumulate reasons.\n   - detect_url(text): find URLs (http/https), shorteners (bit.ly, tinyurl, ow.ly, t.co), suspicious TLDs (.ru, .cn, .tk), query params, tracking patterns.\n   - detect_phone(text): find phone numbers formats (+country, xxx-xxx-xxxx).\n   - detect_email(text): find email patterns.\n   - detect_money_request(text): keywords (wire, transfer, gift card, bitcoin, crypto, payment, bank, account, refund, fee, invoice, loan, payday).\n   - detect_urgency(text): (urgent, immediately, now, 24hrs, last chance, limited time, final notice, act now).\n   - detect_verification(text): (verify, OTP, password, PIN, security code, reset, suspended, locked, confirm).\n   - detect_prize(text): (winner, prize, lottery, sweepstakes, free, claim).\n   - detect_impersonation(text): (IRS, revenue, police, Apple, Microsoft, bank names, delivery services) with simple list.\n   - detect_confusables(text): flag presence of common Unicode confusables; approximate via ranges and normalizing.\n   - detect_excessive_punctuation(text): sequences of !!! ??? or ALL CAPS ratio.\n   - detect_imperatives(text): (click, open, visit, call, reply, send) when followed by links/phones.\n\n4) Scoring: Each heuristic contributes weighted points; compile reasons strings like \"Contains URL (shortener)\", \"Urgency language detected\", etc. Normalize risk_score to 0..1.\n\n5) ML pipeline: If scikit-learn is installed, use:\n   - Pipeline(TfidfVectorizer(ngram_range=(1,2), min_df=1, stop_words='english'), LogisticRegression(max_iter=1000, class_weight='balanced', random_state=42)).\n   - train() fits on provided or built-in sample dataset with labels (\"junk\"/\"legit\").\n   - predict() computes model probability for class \"junk\" and combines: final_score = 0.6 * risk_score + 0.4 * ml_prob (or just risk_score if ml unavailable). Threshold on final_score.\n\n6) CLI usage:\n   - python scam_sms_filter.py --input messages.csv --id-column id --text-column text [--threshold 0.55]\n   - Outputs predictions.csv with columns: id, label, confidence, risk_score, ml_prob, reasons (| separated).\n   - Automatically writes junk messages to junk/junk_messages.json.\n   - If --input is omitted, read lines from stdin (each line is a message, id auto-incremented).\n\n7) Implementation details:\n   - Use only standard library; import scikit-learn optionally in a try/except and disable ML if not available.\n   - Provide built-in tiny training dataset (a dozen examples of junk and legit).\n   - Deterministic behavior: set random seed to 42 where applicable.\n   - Logging: INFO level logs for training, prediction summary, and junk marking.\n   - Robust error-handling and validation; handle empty or very short messages.\n   - Avoid any external network calls or dependencies beyond optional scikit-learn.\n   - Include a __main__ section demonstrating usage with a small in-memory list of sample messages and writing outputs to predictions.csv.\n\n8) Mark-as-junk behavior:\n   - Create junk directory if missing and maintain junk_messages.json as a JSON array (append mode that keeps valid JSON: read existing, append, write back).\n\n9) Documentation:\n   - Top-level docstring explaining the approach, CLI, and API.\n   - Function docstrings and comments describing heuristics and scoring.\n\n10) Security and privacy notes in docstring: No external calls; data stays local; explain limitations and encourage retraining with real datasets.\n\nDeliver the full Python code in a single file that is ready to run. Ensure clean, readable structure and adherence to the above spec.\n",

Requirements:\n\nOverview:\n- The script should be able to:\n  - Launch a program (via a command) or attach to an existing process by PID.\n  - Monitor the process's CPU usage periodically.\n  - Adjust process priority (OS-specific) and set CPU affinity where supported.\n  - Dynamically throttle the process by suspending/resuming it in short cycles to keep CPU usage near a target threshold.\n- Cross-platform support: Windows, Linux, macOS. Handle unsupported features gracefully.\n- Use only standard Python and psutil. No external native dependencies required.\n\nDependencies:\n- Requires Python 3.8+.\n- Requires psutil: `pip install psutil`.\n\nCLI:\n- Use argparse with the following options:\n  - Mutually exclusive: --pid PID or --cmd \"command with args\" (string). One is required.\n  - --target-cpu PERCENT (float, default=50.0). Desired upper bound for average CPU usage of the target process.\n  - --priority {low,normal,high} (optional). Adjust the process priority at start.\n    * On Unix: low -> nice 10, normal -> nice 0, high -> nice -5 (requires elevated privileges).\n    * On Windows: map to BELOW_NORMAL_PRIORITY_CLASS, NORMAL_PRIORITY_CLASS, HIGH_PRIORITY_CLASS.\n  - --affinity \"cpu_index_list\" (optional; e.g., \"0,1,2\"). Set CPU affinity (Windows, Linux). On macOS print a warning that affinity is not supported.\n  - --interval SECONDS (float, default=0.5). Sampling interval for CPU monitoring.\n  - --mode {throttle,balance} (default=throttle):\n    * throttle: actively suspend/resume to cap usage near target.\n    * balance: only adjust priority/affinity; do not suspend/resume.\n  - --window SECONDS (float, default=1.0): control window used to compute throttle cycles.\n  - --log-level {info,debug} (default=info).\n\nBehavior:\n- If --cmd is provided, launch the subprocess using subprocess.Popen with shell=False, split safely using shlex.split on Unix and plain args on Windows. Wrap the PID via psutil.Process after launch.\n- If --pid is provided, attach to existing process using psutil.Process and validate access.\n- If the process terminates, exit gracefully.\n- Priority adjustment:\n  - Implement `set_priority(proc, level)` handling platform-specific mappings and permission errors.\n- Affinity adjustment:\n  - Implement `set_affinity(proc, cpu_list)` using psutil.Process.cpu_affinity on supported platforms.\n  - If not supported (e.g., macOS), log a warning.\n- Monitoring and control loop (for throttle mode):\n  - Use a simple feedback controller:\n    * Measure instantaneous CPU percent using `proc.cpu_percent(interval=interval)`.\n    * Maintain an exponential moving average (EMA) of CPU usage to smooth spikes.\n    * If EMA > target_cpu:\n      - Compute desired duty ratio r = max(0.05, min(0.95, target_cpu / max(EMA, 1e-3))).\n      - For each control window, suspend the process for (1 - r) * window seconds, then resume for r * window seconds.\n      - During resume, still sample CPU to update EMA; if process finishes, exit.\n    * If EMA <= target_cpu, keep the process running; still update EMA.\n  - Use psutil's `proc.suspend()` and `proc.resume()` (works on both Windows and Unix) and guard against exceptions.\n- For balance mode:\n  - Only set priority and affinity, then periodically log CPU usage until the process exits.\n\nSafety & Robustness:\n- Handle exceptions such as AccessDenied, NoSuchProcess, and ZombieProcess.\n- On KeyboardInterrupt (Ctrl+C):\n  - Ensure the process is resumed (if we suspended it).\n  - If we launched the process, offer to terminate it (controlled by a flag or default to leaving it running), but for simplicity just resume and exit.\n- Ensure that child processes are considered: focus on the main target process only; log a note if many child processes exist.\n- Respect platform differences: affinity unsupported on macOS, high priority/nice may require admin/root.\n\nLogging:\n- Implement logging with timestamps and levels using the logging module.\n- Log when priority, affinity, and throttle cycles occur.\n- Periodically output current EMA and instantaneous usage.\n\nCode Structure:\n- Functions:\n  - parse_args()\n  - get_process(args)\n  - set_priority(proc, level)\n  - set_affinity(proc, cpu_list)\n  - throttle_loop(proc, target_cpu, interval, window)\n  - balance_loop(proc, interval)\n  - main()\n- Include helpful docstrings and examples in the module docstring.\n\nExamples (include in module docstring):\n- Launch and cap CPU to 40% with low priority and limit to CPUs 0 and 1:\n  `python cpu_optimizer.py --cmd \"python my_app.py --workload heavy\" --target-cpu 40 --priority low --affinity 0,1`\n- Attach to PID and cap to 50%:\n  `python cpu_optimizer.py --pid 12345 --target-cpu 50 --interval 0.25`\n\nReturn a complete, runnable Python script implementing all the above.\n",

Prefer pure NumPy and Numba parallel first; then fall back to multi-processing for tasks that remain CPU-heavy.\n4) Ensure memory efficiency: preallocate arrays, use in-place operations where safe, choose appropriate dtypes (float32 vs float64) based on precision needs, and chunk large computations to manage RAM.\n5) Provide reproducible results: deterministic seeds for stochastic routines, and document any sources of nondeterminism.\n6) Preserve the public API where possible; where the original API is unknown, expose clear, testable function names and a run_pipeline entry that can serve as a drop-in starting point.\n7) Add docstrings, type hints, logging (INFO/DEBUG), and simple validation of inputs. Include a CLI entry point for batch usage.\n8) Prefer BLAS-backed operations (e.g., matrix multiplications) and NumPy aggregations for performance, and lean on SciPy if available for specialized routines (with runtime fallback if not installed).\n9) Include graceful fallbacks: if numba is unavailable, use pure NumPy paths; if multiprocessing is not desired, allow workers=1 to disable parallel execution.\n10) Structure for maintainability: modular functions, minimal global state, and unit-test-friendly design.\n\nAssumptions about the original file:\n- The original code likely includes nested loops for: pairwise distance calculations, cumulative/statistical aggregations, simulation/Monte Carlo runs, and batch transformations on large arrays.\n- It may read/write large arrays from disk and perform iterative transforms.\n\nImplementation details to include:\n- Core functions:\n  - pairwise_distance_matrix(data: np.ndarray, metric: str = \"euclidean\", chunk_size: int | None = None) -> np.ndarray\n  - monte_carlo_simulation(n_runs: int, initial_state: np.ndarray, step_fn: Callable, seed: int | None = None, parallel: bool = True, workers: int | None = None) -> np.ndarray\n  - batch_transform(data: np.ndarray, transform_fn: Callable[[np.ndarray], np.ndarray], chunk_size: int = 100000, parallel: bool = True, workers: int | None = None) -> np.ndarray\n  - compute_heavy_metrics(data: np.ndarray) -> dict[str, float]  # e.g., vectorized aggregations/stats\n  - run_pipeline(input_path: str | None, output_path: str | None, workers: int | None = None, seed: int | None = 42) -> None\n\n- Vectorization examples:\n  - Replace nested loops in distance calculations with broadcasting: for euclidean: use (X**2).sum(axis=1) and the identity ||x - y||^2 = ||x||^2 + ||y||^2 - 2 x·y, then sqrt.\n  - Use np.einsum or @ for matrix operations.\n  - For aggregations: use np.mean, np.std (ddof controls), np.sum along axes, np.cumsum, np.cumprod, np.quantile, etc.\n\n- Numba examples:\n  - Provide @njit(parallel=True) versions of any remaining tight loops (e.g., a custom metric not easily vectorized). Use prange for parallel reductions and document any parallel semantics.\n  - Ensure functions are typed-friendly and avoid Python objects inside numba-jitted code.\n\n- Parallelization:\n  - Use concurrent.futures.ProcessPoolExecutor for CPU-bound tasks when chunking large inputs. Compute optimal chunk sizes based on data size and number of workers.\n  - Avoid sending huge arrays by slicing into memoryviews or numpy chunks; consider memory-mapped arrays if reading from disk.\n\n- Memory & I/O:\n  - For very large arrays, support np.memmap-based loading to keep memory footprint manageable.\n  - When writing results, use efficient formats (e.g., np.save, np.savez_compressed), with options.\n\n- CLI:\n  - argparse with flags: --input, --output, --workers, --seed, --no-parallel\n  - Example usage: python new_heavy_numeric_computations.py --input data.npy --output results.npz --workers 8\n\n- Logging:\n  - Use logging module; log sizes, dtype choices, chosen chunk sizes, and timing metrics.\n\n- Testing hooks:\n  - Simple sanity checks in __main__: generate synthetic data if --input is not provided, run functions, and save outputs.\n\n- Robustness:\n  - Validate inputs (ndim, shapes), handle NaNs (np.nan* functions where appropriate), and document choices.\n\nDeliverable:\n- A single complete Python file implementing the above, ready to run.\n- Keep external dependencies optional; work with NumPy standard, add numba/scipy usage guarded by try/except imports.\n- Include performance notes in the module docstring.\n",
