Define an amplitude function for quantum states that takes two parameters (x, y) representing quantum state angles. Use a complex quantum superposition formula with exponential terms.\n\n2. Define a probability function that calculates the absolute square of the amplitude.\n\n3. Implement simulated annealing optimization to find the maximum probability within constraints 0 to π/2 for both parameters.\n\n4. Print the maximum probability value and the corresponding angles (x, y) that achieve this maximum.\n\n5. Include visualization using 3D surface plot and contour plot to show the probability landscape.\n\n6. Add proper imports for numpy, scipy.optimize, and matplotlib.\n\nMake the code scientifically accurate with proper quantum computing concepts, using complex exponentials and normalized probability calculations.
